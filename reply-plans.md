I'm more that just adore your plan and how much time you spend, in order to clarify things. With this approach(maybe advancing it a bit)
Tech side can be developed easier and quickly.

I'm a bit upset now, so don't get me hard.
Btw, I'm a part of StartupSchool from YCombinator.
They move their deadline, maybe you should join it as well with separated company and see how it will be going.

Videos from it make me sad, actually.
They touching important topics, that I tried to avoid.
But it's a good meal for my brain, actually.

And still, you even don't see all the progress(it's slowing down, but it's going as waves, usually).

So, while Python team trying to cracj that thing and wasting a lot time.

Why I'm ok with datasets -> it should move us to release of database as service, because right now I don't see other way to get a lot of feedback from market.

Restaurants --> maybe it's good. But without talking with owners, it's a deadend.
Try this -> contact 100 restaurants near you. Pitch your vision to them. And ask if they want to pay upfront for our solution. It will be a real-world test. and will show a number of companies that interested.
Because if they don't care about it now, or not ready to pay at this moment - it will be the same situation later.


Same for grocery stores, most of them have a strict systems, connected to their POS systems, so only very progressive stores(with money) will go
