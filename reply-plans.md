I'm more than just adore your plan and how much time you spend, to clarify things. With this approach(maybe advancing it a bit)
Tech side can be developed easier and quickly.

I'm a bit upset now, so don't get me hard.
Btw, I'm a part of StartupSchool from YCombinator.
They move their deadline, maybe you should join it as well with the separated company and see how it will be going.

Videos from it make me sad.
They touching important topics, that I tried to avoid.
But it's a good meal for my brain.

And still, you even don't see all the progress(it's slowing down, but it's going as waves, usually).

So, while the Python team trying to crack that thing and wasting a lot of time.
we continue to work on dataset that we have from June.


#### Why I'm ok with datasets
 -> it should move us to release of the database as service, because right now I don't see another way to get a lot of feedback from the market.

#### Restaurants
--> maybe it's good. But without talking with owners, it's a dead end.

Try this -> contact 100 restaurants near you. Pitch your vision to them. And ask if they want to pay upfront for our solution. It will be a real-world test. and will show several companies that can be interested.

Because if they don't care about it now, or not ready to pay at this moment - it will be the same situation later.


Same for grocery stores, most of them have strict systems, connected to their POS systems, so only very progressive stores(with money) will go with us forward right now.

#### The idea with scrapping recipes

is good and I think we have some tools that can be used.
But we should be a bit worried about copyright.

I mean, sure, the website looks old and nobody finds us. But it's in a "gray" area for me.
It's better to contact these guys and ask their permissions, maybe they can be our FA members as well.

For sure, I like this vision.
Especially because a lot of our code moving into storing recipes. But if we have users, I think it will be easier to store their recipes that diabetes-friendly.

Imagine this. If you contact 10 doctors, that working with people with diabetes, and they ready at least use our service(and maybe pay for it later) and each doctor has at least 10 patients - then we'll be able to start our MVP with 110 users.


#### backend
I think I will be able in some short amount of time to push our backend stuff to move quickly.
It will require to code on my own, interns are not ready to do it now(maybe later).

I have my old server related to recipes.
I will redo it with a new database language and connect it with a few simple frontend pages(that is also work in process, but I paused it, while I don't see a lot of demand)

So it's like 40% is done for that and I just need to sit down and finish some code on my own.


As I told before, instead of doing a complex project that is located at one place -> I split it into chunks, that my interns can easily digest. Before I make all in one place, but it requires a lot of time to study it.

It's also cool for testing/maintenance and 'server-load'. It's just another architecture-logic, that might now not very useful, but in future, when the project evolves -> it will be a huge advantage for people/costs/time.

I explored different types of "frameworks" that can speed up things, I did it before, but it's more an old fashion way of doing things.

So it's part of my "know-how", that usually used by big teams with proper funding.

So it will be useful if project/projects will become successful or at least launched.


Yesterday I watched a few videos on "how to make a quick backend". In theory, if you want, you can do it in a couple of weeks.

But as I explain before - it will be a good way to showcase something, because it's a small and not working project(or not launched online). But for a long distance --> modular approach is more preferable. Because it will have less crazy logic, and people will be able to work separately, and don't worry about it's complexity.

Example:
if a module has only 5 methods inside -> it can be easily advanced. If a project has 120 functions --> navigating/debugging can be challenging.

If I will have passion -> I'll try to explore a quick way of creating some sort of backend, but still, it will be just for showing some quick results only.

So using my way is more viable.

#### static data
I am currently working on a site, documentation that will show some of our code to the world. It's focused on our static data plugin.

I also started to film courses for coding. It will help me to make some quick money and be able to reduce pressure from a financial point on me.

If courses will go well -> then I'll be able to move part of our projects forward more quickly.

It also can increase the number of my students.

So as you see - we need to make some moves, to continue all this "projects".
