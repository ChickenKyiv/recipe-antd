The one year after working with Interns PT1.

I think that many people be in similar situation:
You want to increase number of team members. Or friend or family member asking you to help and hire a cousin/child that want to
code but have a limited commercial experience. And you have a question in your head: Should I do it? Should I help?
It can be a problem and are your ready to jump into this rabbit hole?


I don't have this choice. I'm building my project without funding and I has only 2 options:
 - I can code myself and maybe go insane
 - Form a team around me
 - (3rd option is to go to a normal work, but ...)
-  (4th option is to get a funding, but ...)

I can form a team of interns, that want TO LEARN and I'm ready to teach. Later, when they be able to work on small tasks, I'll assign these tasks to them and will move my project forward, And this is how this interns give back.

This was my assumption.

[back to the story]

My story of how I tried to search interns in bulk can be easy to follow by places, where I was. And usually I was banned.

----------

[AngelList]

I wrote and send a bunch of similar messages to a different number of people. I have hint that maybe I was reported by my native (соотечественник) I think it's 50% of probability because he was angry on me with my "stupid sales" follow-up messages. And he send a report at support.  Support didn't competely remove me from a platform. I work hard and have good profile with a nice number of connections. But they freeze me, and I cannot add a new connections to my network. I can only follow new people.
But job sections works well. And I still get a new applicants.

[Treehouse]

I was there too and get a good help from support. They advice me to write at their forum. But in order to get an access to it -> I should be a registered and paying customer for their courses [screen]

-----

[Freebootcamp]

it was a strange situation. I think that my message there will be very relative, because it's a website, where students learn how to code and they seek a job. It have an active forum, where people share their job-seeking experience in Tech, but I cannot write there too. Or maybe I need to be more smart. I create a long post with detailed explanation to what I'm looking for. And I immediately got "closed" because of violation of their terms.

-------

[Github]

At some point in summer 2018 I figure out one lifehack. I'm an active GitHub user too, and there a lot of students.
They keeping their code at repositories and usually a tech student, that learn to code via online courses -> store their code here. And usually they keep titles or keywords up-to-date, so it's easy to find someone by tech stack or name of e-learning platform or famous course name. A lot of recruiters searching at Github, so there is nothing new.
I decided to write to this students without any hesitation. I create a task, with title - "let's collaborate" and promote my work in a basic sentences. Maybe I should be more smart again. Do you know that you can find an email of person, that keep their code publicly. Read about it here. I don't think that this is a good idea and hope Github will close this hole. If I use this API way, I think I wouldn't be banned.
I send a message/crete new similar issues at repositories of 100-200 people. And after that I got banned for 1,5 months.
I was upset. Whole my work right now stored there. And support have a fun way to teach me. They hide all created issues by me.
In order to be unblocked - I should remove that spammy title and replace issue content with ".". For all of that "spam"-issues.
And I really work hard in order to clean up that mess. But I also have some rest. Whole work was paralized. So few weeks I was just laying down and read Harry Potter series.
I think you understand at this point of reading article, that I don't want to be tied up to some platforms.
Each project have their rules and it's hard to broke them or didn't violate something.

---

So my advice for you -> don't keep all eggs in one basket. But to be honest -> I finish to look/relate at AngelList a lot of times from June.

But I still get some new interested people, but i'm slowrolling any one right now.


---

This is why I want to have my own separated source of a new interns.  Each project have their rules.
They grow, they change their terms and you actually didn't owe anything.
At any second that you violate terms -> you'll be punished. And it's hard to ПОДСТРАИВАТЬСЯ.

So don't use one major source. But, to be honest, in a long run it works. I was limited ad cannot actively networking at AngelList from June, but I still receive an enquiries from a new people, that want to apply.


Some numbers. I didn't count it precisely from summer, but from the begining i send about 2500 requests to students. A lot of them was interested. Active was 200-230. I setup about 120 interviews and about 60 join me and start to help me with my project.

They start from learning, using same courses/tutorials that i find and use or made myself.
People that didn't leave working on this courses -> they became ready to work with a real tasks and start to code with me my project.
If they didn't gave up -> after touching/collide "real world" -> in a few months the use that knowledge and increase their self-confidence. After this period they start to attend an interviews again and with updated confidence in their skills and maybe with my experience certificate -> the quickly land a real full-time in-office job with salary.
And i'm happy about it. I'm blessed to have an ability to help them and clean up my karma.

Please Clap if this was an interesting to read. Ask questions, if you want.
The next article will have some advice, observations, conclusions, that i made in last year, working with team of interns.

One of my next ideas was about creating an education project. It will be focused on mastering skills. Not just give them to "eat" tutorials, that will be buried in their github accounts, but helping them with facing a realtime experience.
In short Educate students to code on practice....

So if this idea worth exploring for you -> buzz me. I will be happy to chat or get any help or advice. Also I was teaching on skillshare. My assumption was that this will drove more attention, but it doesnt'...
