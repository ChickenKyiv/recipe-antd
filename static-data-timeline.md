Fetch
1) get stuck with tech decision

2) moving away data from our API servers

3) creating separated repository

4) creating few releases of fetch plugin

5) create a few separated projects inside of fetch, in order to be able to install fetch at different node projects, React projects as well.

6) create long task with details at GitHub issues for

7) Keeping all interns together and give them a clear image of what we actually doing here.

8) start to write about static data at Medium.

- create fake-api server in order to have better flow and be able to connect data at React project.

- fetch get 1000 commits

- decide to separated JSON with methods, again.

- prepare fetch to transition to ES6 style.

----------

SD born as separated repository.

moved data there. Install rollup.
figure out how to handle it with json files. publish at npm, connect with fetch, remove same data from fetch. working together.

----

- Moving generator script at sd repository

- Creating csv parser inside of sd repository
parsers working with one dataset. Adding another dataset making this project more complex.

----


separating generator at independent module updating flow of coding, more clean issues, simple milestones, code clean up, release it on npm.

----

starting to think about separated product for PH.

---

start to work on content for a website

start to use Docusaurus for website

start to post information about this module at HN forum.

---

more separated notes about tasks, releases, explanations into one place and print it on paper.

--

start to think about presentation level -->

how to show all our progress, work that was done with possible clients, so he/she can easily start to use it and have more benefits from it...

---

trying to split fetch into small chunks in order to be able to release features more quickly and have lesst confusing code, simple turnaround and make it more short and less buggy.


----

removing generator code from sd

---

removing csv parser code from sd

csv parser as separated repository

trying to make it clean, also should work with different datasets, creating tests, updating methods in order to make them less confusing . interns started to work on it.

moving parsers methods into 3rd generations versions

all datasets should be parsed and exported working similar and without any duplicates.

fix all @TODOS ,, make it less confusing code parts.

it should work fine with generator module as well..
