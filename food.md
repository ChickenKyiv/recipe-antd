People inside at alliance can collaborate, share basic knowledge, etc.
- designers can design (I think i have a collection of dribbble designs, related to food websites)
- startups can share their services
- developers can share code or collaborate together.
- coins can be used for paying developers. Like OpenCollective or GitCoin for supporting free tools.

Maybe we need to have a forum too. with a separated places for discussing a different problems/things. Make it open or closed? Not sure. Coding school can be a cool part of it too. Because my interns are coding food modules. So they actually learning about food.

- mechanics can collaborate with coders, making hardware and sotfware together.
- documentation, related to basic knowledge, with FAQs, etc.
- codebase can be used together too

Should this knowledgebase be free or we need to have some sort of private club with recuring subscription/donations?

- recipe creators can create food and share it, sell, etc.
- food photographers/video makers can be useful here too

It may help with crowdfunding. Or food incubators can see profiles of those statups and get a better understanding about what tool is cool.
Maybe some big companies can `eat` small companies, or people cross-invest money in small companies, or exchange their stocks. Maybe teams can share their developers for building some opensource tools or move them between companies.
Maybe we can have a deals page.

One goal for FA is to reduce costs of development a website, related to "food tech". Another idea is related to promoting small projects, foodies profiles. One of websites, that I was built with my help, was went out from business at 2018. it has a great software behind it(no joking, I mean it). Usually I don't like my code -> `cause it can be (there is) always a room for improvement. But that software still not sucks(after a few years). But she don't have skills in promoting it. But that code is dead now. (!) because she is a chef. Costs was high for her budget, she got a loan from bank, and then decided to close it. And this situation making me feel sad. I don't want to have similar stories in future. And I have a will to try to change it. I don't want to think that it is my failture. I mean I was just a contractor. Actually, we did more than was expected from us. But i cannot leave it behind. I still have an idea to meet someone, who will understand a quality of that software, and make her an offer and buy a full working project for 50-70 grands and raise it from the ashes.

============

I have a list of small websites(https://artplusmarketing.com/why-nobody-will-use-my-product-startup-anti-vision-285e2cb0db1e). They usually owned by Moms, that have passion in building/making meals for their family. But they are busy and quite often dont have MBA, sales skills or an abilities to learn how to promote their business. This is a place, where can be handy my other idea of building a simple website generator. Right now we have a lot of simple tools, that can be a good choise for beginners. They are easy to use, populate content and it's not a WordPress. I have a collection of food startups at AngelList, at ProductHunt and just a random 200-300 recipe blogs from Pinterest. And each of then can benefit from my experience. This is actually Why I love communities so much. Example: around Nodejs are a lot of amaizing people. And it have a good ecosystem of modules, that really saving a lot of time. That is really pleasant for me -> because I dont want to reinvent the wheel of creating another 'login forms for ABC'. Just another example: foodie goes designer and ask for quiote for "custom" food website. or app. or something. It actually not a very custom at all. They always pretty similar. But as he/she asking a quiote of creating from scratch with client wishes -> it has a really big price tag(by big i mean it's an actual time, that designer will spend time, in order to wrap his head around the project and create it). But at web we have a TONS of designs about food. Like dashboards -> they are everywhere. Like all people wanna have/create an Uber app for $3000 or insurance company website with calculator for $3000 as well :) I stored that links for myself, in order to analyze them. Is it can be a timesaver? yes. Money saver? yes again.
