People inside at alliance can collaborate, share basic knowledge, etc.
- designers can design (I think i have a collection of dribbble designs, related to food websites)
- startups can share their services
- developers can share code or collaborate together.
- coins can be used for paying developers. Like OpenCollective or GitCoin for supporting free tools.

Maybe we need to have a forum too. with a separated places for discussing a different problems/things. Make it open or closed? Not sure. Coding school can be a cool part of it too. Because my interns are coding food modules. So they actually learning about food.

- mechanics can collaborate with coders, making hardware and sotfware together.
- documentation, related to basic knowledge, with FAQs, etc.
- codebase can be used together too

Should this knowledgebase be free or we need to have some sort of private club with recuring subscription/donations?

- recipe creators can create food and share it, sell, etc.
- food photographers/video makers can be useful here too

It may help with crowdfunding. Or food incubators can see profiles of those statups and get a better understanding about what tool is cool.
Maybe some big companies can `eat` small companies, or people cross-invest money in small companies, or exchange their stocks. Maybe teams can share their developers for building some opensource tools or move them between companies.
Maybe we can have a deals page.

Diets are one of the bigest topics, that can /should be addressed. I have an interest in diets personally. I'm fat right now, so weight-loss is important for me. Last 5-6 years diets are on upstreak(this is time when I'm checking them)

And this is nothing a new here. "Diets" is a term that selling easily, than a "meal planning".

When you try to convince user to use a meal planning service -> get confused. Not everyone understand a reason why to use it. And pay for it. And here is a good place for use a static website generator as well. I send message to a lot of nutritionists. Nobody understands me. Or what I want from them. One girl only was interested. It was a year ago. I create a specification for her project(all was free, just in sake of being helpful). She realized that this is a complex thing, and she is busy to deal with it. But! I have that specification, so when I'll back to this idea -> I have data to start with.
