People inside at alliance can collaborate, share basic knowledge, etc.
- designers can design (I think i have a collection of dribbble designs, related to food websites)
- startups can share their services
- developers can share code or collaborate together.
- coins can be used for paying developers. Like OpenCollective or GitCoin for supporting free tools.

Maybe we need to have a forum too. with a separated places for discussing a different problems/things. Make it open or closed? Not sure. Coding school can be a cool part of it too. Because my interns are coding food modules. So they actually learning about food.

- mechanics can collaborate with coders, making hardware and sotfware together.
- documentation, related to basic knowledge, with FAQs, etc.
- codebase can be used together too

Should this knowledgebase be free or we need to have some sort of private club with recuring subscription/donations?

- recipe creators can create food and share it, sell, etc.
- food photographers/video makers can be useful here too

It may help with crowdfunding. Or food incubators can see profiles of those statups and get a better understanding about what tool is cool.
Maybe some big companies can `eat` small companies, or people cross-invest money in small companies, or exchange their stocks. Maybe teams can share their developers for building some opensource tools or move them between companies.
Maybe we can have a deals page.

============

I have a list of small websites(https://artplusmarketing.com/why-nobody-will-use-my-product-startup-anti-vision-285e2cb0db1e). They usually owned by Moms, that have passion in building/making meals for their family. But they are busy and quite often dont have MBA, sales skills or an abilities to learn how to promote their business. This is a place, where can be handy my other idea of building a simple website generator. Right now we have a lot of simple tools, that can be a good choise for beginners. They are easy to use, populate content and it's not a WordPress. I have a collection of food startups at AngelList, at ProductHunt and just a random 200-300 recipe blogs from Pinterest. And each of then can benefit from my experience. This is actually Why I love communities so much. Example: around Nodejs are a lot of amaizing people. And it have a good ecosystem of modules, that really saving a lot of time. That is really pleasant for me -> because I dont want to reinvent the wheel of creating another 'login forms for ABC'. Just another example: foodie goes designer and ask for quiote for "custom" food website. or app. or something. It actually not a very custom at all. They always pretty similar. But as he/she asking a quiote of creating from scratch with client wishes -> it has a really big price tag(by big i mean it's an actual time, that designer will spend time, in order to wrap his head around the project and create it). But at web we have a TONS of designs about food. Like dashboards -> they are everywhere. Like all people wanna have/create an Uber app for $3000 or insurance company website with calculator for $3000 as well :) I stored that links for myself, in order to analyze them. Is it can be a timesaver? yes. Money saver? yes again.

Right now my team working with a few code repositories, related to food static data
https://github.com/GroceriStar/groceristar-fetch
https://github.com/GroceriStar/sd
https://github.com/GroceriStar/sd-plain
https://github.com/GroceriStar/static-food-data-documentation

Goal is to launch a project, a npm package, that will give foodies or developers an access to some basic data, db tables, and without spending time on architecting a huge and complex database, they can be able to grab that data go forward.
I have repositories, I have list of articles, I have plans at Github issues and also some stack of papers with details. In the end, first release will be published + website on Githhub and will have a separated docusaurus(documentation space).
By my plan we need to post a very basic version(I call it "clean" data release). But later we'll show all "dirty" data, that we are currently working on. It also have a minimalistic and clean code, so in my mind is to make it very easy to install and use. And as code is simple - my interns with low coding skills are being able to contribute to it. We actually using that modules in our different projects. So it's a bit cross-technology at the moment. RIght now we're using it with: Nodejs+express server, React components, graphQL server, plain VanillaJs is available too. It's not limited to JS only actually. Static files right now have JSON format, so people can grab it and use at their tech stack as well.
As I worked on Recipe-api some time ago(db architecture + schemas, I find out that REST is good, but it has some disadvantages and with rise of GrapgQL in last three years I'm switching our development to building a graphql server and I have a lot of data for it as well). Links for beginners as myself. https://github.com/ChickenKyiv/awesome-graphql-beginner-links

Major ways of making money for foodie blogs are:
- personalized ads at sidebar, giveaways/daily deals, promoted articles, affialite purchases(like personalized Amazon from products/kitchen tools). And selling cooking books. Cooking book doesn't cost a lot, and usually, girls, that publish recipes frequently -> can just grab a similar recipes by some topic, or based on occasions aka holiday specials("Christmass food for small budgets", "SuperBowl sneaks for big company"). Each book have a price around 5 buck(online doc) and have a pretty similar content/layout. About author page, intro page, message from an author, list of recipes with notes from chef, TOC, outro. And only some of foodies knows how it's easy right now to create design/layout for recipe book, or weekly menu or something similar, like flyers, etc. Only content is a hard part. And as I'm aware about this thing, one of my ideas is related to helping them to publish their books. A lot of publishing DIY platforms are awailable right now.

Dran-d-drop builders are dominating right now and it can give you an ability to create a document, you can publish it and also have a printed verions as well. You can get a discount, related to amount of books that you want to print at paper.
Foodies also needed a separated landing page, with countdown, text with information about book, book preview, maybe an advertising video, or crowdfunding/pre-order page. + cover image with food background and white/black title.
As you see, not a rocket science or blockchain.

If we're simplifying it to a really low level - recipe book can have this layout, food image on right/left side, recipe content with fancy "girly" font + page numbers. And it's done. Document format is PDF, add price for some payment gateway and secure a file from unpurchased/expired downloading. It will be cool to create an Import/Export tool, that can export recipe data and then automatically prepare pages with illustrations into a draft version of book. And later client can drag-n-drop block as she wish. and use maybe draft.js for content.

Canva is good example of what i mean.

Landing page builders - cheaper that developer and with good taste

One of my code projects is Groceristar.
It's about working with grocery lists, we decided to create an OCR script, and it's very hungry for data. Like a lot of data. I went to Pinterest and collected about 200 different grocery lists at least. Maybe we need to sort them and share with people as well. So anyone can benefit from it. It will be a cool time, when we will convert them in digital versions(There also a copyright problem - I don't know how to credit an owners properly and handle it right now)
I also have a set of articles, about this OCR script []

Diets are one of the bigest topics, that can /should be addressed. I have an interest in diets personally. I'm fat right now, so weight-loss is important for me. Last 5-6 years diets are on upstreak(this is time when I'm checking them)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1469198/57344405-cb610900-714f-11e9-8be8-5032d0a29965.png)

And this is nothing a new here. "Diets" is a term that selling easily, than a "meal planning".

- https://medium.com/@arthurtkachenko/ways-to-promote-healthy-lifestyle-in-kids-c2fcb047486d
- https://medium.com/groceristar/meal-planning-calendar-8526754813cc
- https://medium.com/groceristar/junk-food-whats-inside-it-12896eb0afd0

When you try to convince user to use a meal planning service -> get confused. Not everyone understand a reason why to use it. And pay for it. And here is a good place for use a static website generator as well. I send message to a lot of nutritionists. Nobody understands me. Or what I want from them. One girl only was interested. It was a year ago. I create a specification for her project(all was free, just in sake of being helpful). She realized that this is a complex thing, and she is busy to deal with it. But! I have that specification, so when I'll back to this idea -> I have data to start with.
