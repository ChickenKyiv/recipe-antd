 Today I get a question, what I'll do if coding school will be a failure.
 but I was ready to it and shout loudly, that content
 marketing is a cool thing, so we'll publish more content at HN.
 And I tell - that if 10 articles wouldn't be enough - I'll create another 10. and remember, that I decide to google a practice tasks, I start to google practical tasks in JS, because of it most simple that I can find.

 Article: Practical articles for people, that want to learn or learned and want to sharpen things. like tasks, similar that I create for people that want to learn flexboxes.


 + I have a dumb, but working cool for a git+github task for promises, at ES6, tasks after learning Nodejs+express, tasks graphql, React, forms, HTML/CSS, Grids.

But how to count success/failure?
We cannot just have some state about it. We need to have KPI -> this will help us.
If 1) I will see growth in numbers of new interns at first months in 2x - it will a good result.
2) if companies will be interested to use our services - it's awesome and
 will show to me that this idea is viable and can be monetized
 3) if for the first 3 months I will see "emptiness" and later i'll see result-> this is just paused not first momentup, so with a right actions and using basic growthhacking actus in order to increase numbers that we have.
