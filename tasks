Generator is a huge thing. So maybe details is necessary.

Graphql subproject.
our task for it is to generate about 5-8 files, that we're generating here.
Methods we actually grabbing and moving from `fetch` module.

ChickenKyiv - it's using recipe-antd, fake-api
Groceristar - used at groceristar-showcase, main groceristar-backend server.

Units - Wahaj started to work on it. We generated files. We need methods for it.
Recipe Search - it's part of recipe-api, so it's used a similar db-schema. Same data used in our recipe-box React Components, aka Selects, Website blocks.

We also need to move some (not all) tests from `fetch`, because it's part of our current functionality. We just making our code, better and simplier.

Cups.js, that was created by Elnur from scratch(thanks for this). It's
actually part of measurements system, that will be later integrated together.

Meal Calendar: it's actually part of recipe-api server(groceristar is actually part of recipe-api as wel, but right now we're not ready to merge them)/

calendar will display recipes by days. Right now it's low level of priority, but maybe by simplifying our code, we will be able to able to make it work faster.

Measurements/Unit Convertion is also part of recipe-api and partially to groceristar, later will be integrated with recipes objects.

Nutritions it's also a part of recipe-api and it's important
 for projects. that rely on nutritional values, like diets.

 JsonValidator - > we didn't implement it yet. But it very important
  part of generator. Because we need to validate our file schemes, especially while files have data inside in minified way(which is good)

  Separation like how we did it -> will help us later to work on translating this data to other languages.
  Because right now we only working with English and this is
  not cool. like if  someone from Frensh - he wouldnt be able totally use it and benefit from our work
