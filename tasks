Generator is a huge thing. So maybe details is necessary.


---------
In order to move forward and efficiently forward - we need to define goals for each of 4 current members here.
(Danielle, Ashley, Yan, Arthur). All of us right now focused at nutritional values/calories intake. If each of us will tell about this goals, it will be easy to figure out our next moves.

My goal is: increasing speed and launch my projects/increasing future functinality, that each of us will be able to use. All of our members are here. Maybe format of this forum should evolve later, but for mow I'm happy with current state of this thread. By sharing here all data in ore place I laos want to publish some quick articles on Hackernoon.
That articles can get us an additional visiblity. About my launches.
I have one project for coding school(98% done) just procrastinating to finish it.
Later I plan to launch static food data as package. I think on ProductHunt it will gain some traction, same with this thread.

---

So I have a team and I have a big amount of unfinished code. But as I see a promise here, I'll finish and release a few modules quickly.

For example, for Yan project a lot of thing is completed. He have opt-repo. And he has an automatical form with calculations.
How for me was interested to collaborate at this project?
How I can help him?

I have 2 un-finished frontend forms. One form related to add recipe to storage. Second is recipe/meal search form with components, that partially completed.
For example, we have food attributes(different type of them) and I have ready SelectField, that ready to display food attributes. Or something else.

I compared different plugins for select field and pick most "nice" to use at our case.
This is a typical problem in web development right now.

For some cases things works, for some - by any different small features -> break everything that convert cool tool into a bad tool for one case.

So I or my team members can quite fast create form Yan, but Using React, and he will be able to use his backend and send his data as he wants.
For me -> I'll be able to finish some of unfinished code/modules and post a completed frontend components and receive an additional attention to this thread.
With this approach I got a real tasks/goal and quality of code will be increased.

Search can be interesting to Ashley as well.
All my projects like chains so when i finish one, I have abilitiers to move next one forward.
But as I see interest in your projects for me - I can change my focus a bit.

Problems in my process. new part3I want to prepare one major basic plan for interns(likea checklist), and it should understand notonly what task they have, like(taday you need to do this and in 1 month you'll know how to do more)
but see what they next tasks are and see whole picture and what other team members doing and how.
I think that it's possible inside Github Issues, but we need to have will and time to do it.

So everyone will be able to see a whole progress, that team doing.
I like an approach of one manage, that I was happy to work with. He managed a few projects at the sme time.
Few of them were drowning and he send each day/3 days - a follow up emails. At this emails he explains, what tasks right now I should work on. For me, as developer at that moment - it was a very comfortable approach to work under his control - I always saw and knerw what I should do and in what order.
I don't needed to check JIRA, follow long conversations, etc.
My work was just type and follow his orders. just code whole days
His work was about reducing time, that i spend (and in duying project in increase costs for competition) he also tried to understand my workflow and tried to find a balance between his plan and my work.
His an asshole, he "forget" to pay for my team services around $300 but it's not my problem anymore. He was from Russia, migrated to USA, so I was not surprised.

- I should spend more time to apply an agile approach inside of my projects, and teach my developers to use them.

- Part of team members, have not only dev skills. They also have an active position and experience organizing work at Univercities, campuses, communities, etc.
We have to give more freedom to a new team members, so they will be able to grab management to their hands and move projects independently.
- We need to track developers, that start to think about leavign us. And find a reson, why they want to finish our collaboration.

At most cases people are busy or don't like my approach. It can be a default fatigue, or don't have a free time to learn new things, personal situations, etc...

Curious question for me - how quickly to figure out level of their skills at the begining. Because when I read at their CVs(I know JS, HTML, CSS, Java, .Net, Python) - I understand they don't know that languages... It's a real life, not books, my friend!

I understand  - their knowledge is limited to university courses. But how to make onboarding process easy? Write more articles? Explain logic of how GitHub works, GitHub Issues, Github Labels, GH milestones?
Explain how to collaborate, work with tasks, pull requests?


x) Only small number of interns are working with us more than 3 months in a row.
- it can be related to non-paid composition
- student can actively seeking full time job with salary, not experience and find a jobs
- laziness (why not?)
- complexity of our tasks, boredom with our tasks, that they cannot quickly solve...
