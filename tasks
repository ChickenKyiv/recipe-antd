 Article: Why GitHub is better than any profiles for software engineers



  Article: Practical articles for people, that want to learn or learned and want to sharpen things. like tasks, similar that I create for people that want to learn flexboxes.


  + I have a dump, but working cool for a git+github task for promises, at ES6, tasks after learning Nodejs+express, tasks graphql, React, forms, HTML/CSS, Grids.

Config Generator -- why we comment a few things, methods?
if we don't need them. lets then add and comment more objects. and hide them for next times?

for generator -- we need to create folders for each generated file as well(compare with `src/data`).

filesES5 -- we have very long paths
we should make it less long. we can update to ```var { resolve } = require('path') and make files easy to read again.

Another story. One guy finds me at AngelList. We are a bright guy and won Coding Olympiad in Ukraine. I think that he wants to join us, but he was just curious to know about what Ukrainian company doing at AngelList. And here I should mention that he was "talk down" with me.
And it pisses me off a bit. So, I think that I need to share this. I think that coding Olympiads in Ukraine is bullshit.
(Ok, Ok, don't kill me quick, please - it's my opinion). Again, coding, not science Olympiad, like physics, mathematics.
Why? I have a lot of good friends from India. They are bright people and it's an honor to know them. They are popular students at their university.
Why? They took part at Amazon Hackathon and code bots/assistants for Amazon Echo.
They worked on real practical problems. They work in a team and compete at the tough competition. And win. Took first places and get few USD grans at their hands.
Become an Amazon Influencer Students. And it's in 1000 times more important and valuable.
Cooler than our Olympiads. More prestigious as well. They can use their knowledge right now.
They can sell their skills and get a job. Make money. And be able to support their families. Or they can create a company, sell their products.
End of this story. And I'm upset about it. In Ukraine, we have a great STEM education. But at the next steps: buildings worldwide useful products, promote and sell it => we suck.
Hope it will change in the future. Hoping for changes.



In order to onboard new students and work on some quick and simple tasks -> we need to improve our system of labels/tags/milestones in our repositories. Maybe data/good idea will be to merge some of our modules together into a mono repository on one roof.
Maybe it will help to update packages.
It will also reduce the number of our repositories/ releases and interns wouldn't need to jump between repositories(but it can be a good thing)

But labels are the most important improvement for me. it's great because will reduce numbers of these projects, will reduce the level of knowledge, while a new student will enter point to this project.
Tags/Milestones for different things: tests/work with arrays, work with objects, promises, React components, etc.

"Help us to build the next generation of engineers together with you!" - can be our slogan


Introducing a new member into the team working at the project is a hard thing. It not changing if the member is experienced or not. This is why maybe everyone like to start a new project. Project structure/logic can be simple ==> but it wouldn't reduce problems at the beginning. This is why planning is important. I also need to time management myself and spend more time on project documentation. Readme file will be our first point of information. Next stage will be related to long term planning. A month ago my friend decides to join us. He is experienced, and grab to work on one module. By mistake, he grabs one of the modules, with bad documentation and complex structure.
Who is this problem? He has skills, and should easily jump into this code. But it's my problem. So each member needs some time and a good explanation.
A good plan will be also a good helping hand for quick onboarding.





Article about articles for new developers[strange title, yep]
One month ago my Internet was shut down. I don't have cash for it. I plan to move out. My intern, Vadim take responsibilities for team management. And here I start to saw problems in my process.
One of the quick improvements that we did after -> issues & pull request templates.
I teach him bad habits: make short task description, pull requests without details, etc. He should automate this thing. I also forgot to put data at Readme,
and this is a black hole for a time when each level of the project.
Anyone don't understand what we're doing.
This is my practical findings. Later.
Right now I just watching, how Vadim manages the process. Don't interrupt, so he can realize,
how it hard to work with new people and have responsibility for the work of other teammates.
Not only code by yourself, but more tasks to other developers. It might be easy work, but it's new for him, and complex to start from the beginning. But I'm sure he can handle that.

JSON validator is an actually a good thing
standard --> awesome and 0 coding/0 configuration ESLint

Travis CI --> for builds, great works and helps me a lot, code at master works and module has a good test coverage(tests passing green)

Next Story - How my intern tried to get an internship at the Ukrainian outsourcing company.
Vadim(my 1st Ukrainian  intern) has an official period of practice in college. After that period, he should provide documents, stamps and other boring papershit.
As I cannot provide it for him - I decided - I should help, because he is my teammate and because he rocks.
And I have a lot of connections in our Ukrainian tech companies.

FA
app templates/
This is an item where I don't want to reinvent the wheel. But maybe we'll.
I want to use what web is full - samples and modify or evolve app designs or app code templates that are selling on the marketplaces and they are just static, not evolving during a time, not providing additional value for customers. They just are set as it is.
I saw a lot of duplicates, some of them better than others, but always they require a lot of work to do. I have a very good list of apps/website templates, designs for meals, maybe some sketches/tries at Dribbble. Making something simple and free - that designers on Dribble get a cool experience, and I want to try to simplify the process(real life) or all parts of this process.
it can also bring some clients to those designers - promote their work.


=================







Here is a set of different websites that can help you to get a job in a tech company.
They are maybe not very popular right now. Or very local. But there you'll have less competition, so it worse exploring.



If you also want to get more information about working in tech(right now there a lot of changes) - below I put a list of articles, that might be interested for you to read.
