 Article: Why GitHub is better than any profiles for software engineers



  Article: Practical articles for people, that want to learn or learned and want to sharpen things. like tasks, similar that I create for people that want to learn flexboxes.


  + I have a dump, but working cool for a git+github task for promises, at ES6, tasks after learning Nodejs+express, tasks graphql, React, forms, HTML/CSS, Grids.

Config Generator -- why we comment a few things, methods?
if we don't need them. lets then add and comment more objects. and hide them for next times?

for generator -- we need to create folders for each generated file as well(compare with `src/data`).

filesES5 -- we have very long paths
we should make it less long. we can update to ```var { resolve } = require('path') and make files easy to read again.

Another story. One guy finds me at AngelLIst. We are a bright guy and won Coding Olympiad in Ukraine. I think that he wants to join us, but he was just curious to know about what Ukrainian company doing at AngelList. And here I should mention that he was "talk down" with me.
And it pisses me off a bit. So, I think that I need to share this. I think that coding Olympiads in Ukraine is bullshit.
(Ok, Ok, don't kill me quick, please - it's my opinion). Again, coding, not science Olympiad, like physics, mathematics.
Why? I have a lot of good friends from India. They are bright people and it's an honor to know them. They are popular students at their university.
Why? They took part at Amazon Hackathon and code bots/assistants for Amazon Echo.
They worked on real practical problems. They work in a team and compete at the tough competition. And win. Took first places and get few USD grans at their hands.
Become an Amazon Influencer Students. And it's in 1000 times more important and valuable.
Cooler than our Olympiads. More prestigious as well. They can use their knowledge right now.
They can sell their skills and get a job. Make money. And be able to support their families. Or they can create a company, sell their products.
End of this story. And I'm upset about it. In Ukraine, we have a great STEM education. But at the next steps: buildings worldwide useful products, promote and sell it => we suck.
Hope it will change in the future. Hoping for changes.



In order to onboard new students and work on some quick and simple tasks -> we need to improve our system of labels/tags/milestones in our repositories. Maybe data/good idea will be to merge some of our modules together into mono repository on one roof.
Maybe it will help to update packages.
It will also reduce number of our repositories/ releases and interns woudln't need to jump between repositories(but it can be a good thing)

But labels are most important improvement for me. it's great because will reduce number indeis of projects, will reduce level of knowledge, while new student will enter point to this project.
Tags/Milestones for different things: tests/work with arrays, work with objects, promises, React components, etc.

"Help us to build a next generation of engineers together with you!" - can be our slogan


Introducing new member into team working at project is a hard thing. It not changing if member are experienced ornot. This is why maybe everyone like to start a new project. Project strucutre/logic can be simple ==> but it wouldn't reduce problems at the begining. This is why planning is important. I also need timemanagement myself and spend more time for project documentation. Readme file will be our first point of information. Next stage will be related to long term planning. Month ago my friend decide to join us. He is experienced, and grab to work on one module. By mistake, he grab one of modules, with bad documentation and complex strucutre.
Who is this problem? He have skills, and should easily jump into this code. But it's my problem. So each member need some time and good explanation.
Good plan will be also a good helpful hand for quick onboarding.


In order to improve our process
--- mark tasks in progress
--- create a few milestones and assign tasks to mathematics
--- use Projects, for better understanding

3 points for tests
--- Travis CI
--- JSONLint
--- tests for/from data folders
--- tests for generator folder

we run `code-fix` (ESLint) at build, so small issues will be fixed automatically or show warning.

by using tests we need to answer these questions
- How better to cover `data` folder
- measurements contain a few files, how tests dealing with it
- Elnur add a few files, and tests to them -> what and how it works....

Readme improvement
tests discussion


Article about articles for new developers[strange title, yep]
One month ago my Internet was shutdown. I don't have cash for it. I plan to move out. My intern, Vadim take responsibilities for team management. And here I start to saw problems in my process.
One of the quick improvements that we did after -> issues & pull request templates.
I teach him bad habits: make short task description, pull requests without details, etc. He should automate this thing. I also forgot to put data at Readme,
and this is a black hole for time when each level of project.
Anyone don't understand what we're doing.
This is my practical findings. More later.
Right now I just watching, how Vadim manage process. Don't interrupting, so he can realize,
how it hard to work with new people and have responsibility for work of other teammates.
Not only code by yourself, but more tasks to other developers. It might be easy work, but it's a new for him, and complex to start from the begigning. But i'm sure he can handle that.

complex recipe + tests
grocery_calendar.json

recipes_nutrition.json

JSON validator is an actually a good thing
standard --> awesome and 0 coding/0 configuration ESLint

Travis CI --> for builds, great works and helps me a lot, code at master works and module has a good test coverage(tests passing green)
