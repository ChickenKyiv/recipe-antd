 Today I get a question, what I'll do if coding school will be a failure.
 but I was ready to it and shout loudly, that content
 marketing is a cool thing, so we'll publish more content at HN.
 And I tell - that if 10 articles wouldn't be enough - I'll create another 10. and remember, that I decide to google a practice tasks, I start to google practical tasks in JS, because of it most simple that I can find.

But how to count success/failure?
We cannot just have some state about it. We need to have KPI -> this will help us.

1) If I will see growth in numbers of new interns at first months in 2x - it will a good result.
2) If companies will be interested to use our services - it's awesome and
 will show to me that this idea is viable and can be monetized
3) If for the first 3 months I will see "emptiness" and later i'll see result-> this is just paused not first momentup, so with a right actions and using basic growthhacking actus in order to increase numbers that we have.

 Article: Why GitHub is better than any profiles for software engineers



  Article: Practical articles for people, that want to learn or learned and want to sharpen things. like tasks, similar that I create for people that want to learn flexboxes.


  + I have a dumb, but working cool for a git+github task for promises, at ES6, tasks after learning Nodejs+express, tasks graphql, React, forms, HTML/CSS, Grids.

Config Generator -- why we comment a few things, methods?
if we don't need them. lets then add and comment more objects. and hide them for next times?

for generator -- we need to create a folder as well.

filesES5 -- we have very long paths
we should make it less long. we can update to ```var { resolve } = require('path') and make files easy to read again.

First of all - sure, you are a founder and make a decision.
I'm always open to help and ready to conversation. Especially if it will help to community members.

If we loock back(i have more detailed explanation at this post)
you will find out that for your project you
1) will need a database -> recipe/meal storage
2) in order to give an ability users to watch your content -> you'll need users/profile section
3) if you need to receive payments you'll need to connect your project with payment gateweay
4) You'll also need most common thing like sign in/sing up forms/reset password form/payment form, order tof purchases/refunds, etc.

You can doin on your own for sure. But as you not a
person with tech skills, you'll have to face a common problems, that facing each founder that want to build  an online tool(website/app/voice assistant)
But all of this things are in future for you.
Let's go to a simple things. I saw your project Homepage.
I'm sure that you understand that it can look better. The easiest/quick/cheap way to update it is:
 - create and host a landing page that can be done by drag-n-drop at some of this simple services:
 -
 -
 -

 it will cost you some money, but it's way cheaper than hiring a designer/developer/website administrator.
 You will be able to connect your mailchimp form and good locking and optimized page will boost your convertion without a doubts.

 I'm still confliced. What project size/team size is an ideal in our case? How detailed description should be, in order to people can start quickly? What size of description should we keep everyhint at Readme?
 Before I did a few complex and detailed description, loud Readme, but with myinterns. I didn't feel it myself. like I made X work on docs and will it give Y increase and feedback from students.
 As manager, I think I'll forced to extend my skills with operating of remote team. I should make calls, create videos with tasks explanation.
 What is also not cool, that we have only a progress with tasks, modules, that I have high priority and focus. So, if I think that some module are not important at this moment --> so nobody working on it, which is strange and stupid. Because at this moment we don't need it, but in 2 months it can be ready and we'll be able to work, using that codebase.

 Quite not sure about geo location. I understand what do youwant. and maybe simple "Home mode" is easy to do. Next part is more complex:
 1) with latest release of iOS they rewrite policy about privacy/sharing
 2) with this kind of feature you'll have to be ready for a long approval process. Each new release can take months from code review.
 3) it better to overcome with same outside things like QR scans or other. but it will require a lot of data. Maybe by starting with hyper-local community like 1 town only. at other cases you'll drown with changes, so you'll need a huge and flexible team.
