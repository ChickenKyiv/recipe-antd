Article about articles for new developers[strange title, yep]
One month ago my Internet was shut down. I don't have cash for it. I plan to move out. My intern, Vadim take responsibilities for team management. And here I start to saw problems in my process.
One of the quick improvements that we did after -> issues & pull request templates.
I teach him bad habits: make short task description, pull requests without details, etc. He should automate this thing. I also forgot to put data at Readme,
and this is a black hole for a time when each level of the project.
Anyone don't understand what we're doing.
This is my practical findings. Later.
Right now I just watching, how Vadim manages the process. Don't interrupt, so he can realize,
how it hard to work with new people and have responsibility for the work of other teammates.
Not only code by yourself, but more tasks to other developers. It might be easy work, but it's new for him, and complex to start from the beginning. But I'm sure he can handle that.

JSON validator is an actually a good thing
standard --> awesome and 0 coding/0 configuration ESLint

Travis CI --> for builds, great works and helps me a lot, code at master works and module has a good test coverage(tests passing green)

Next Story - How my intern tried to get an internship at the Ukrainian outsourcing company.
Vadim(my 1st Ukrainian  intern) has an official period of practice in college. After that period, he should provide documents, stamps and other boring papershit.
As I cannot provide it for him - I decided - I should help, because he is my teammate and because he rocks.
And I have a lot of connections in our Ukrainian tech companies.

FA
app templates/
This is an item where I don't want to reinvent the wheel. But maybe we'll.
I want to use what web is full - samples and modify or evolve app designs or app code templates that are selling on the marketplaces and they are just static, not evolving during a time, not providing additional value for customers. They just are set as it is.
I saw a lot of duplicates, some of them better than others, but always they require a lot of work to do. I have a very good list of apps/website templates, designs for meals, maybe some sketches/tries at Dribbble. Making something simple and free - that designers on Dribble get a cool experience, and I want to try to simplify the process(real life) or all parts of this process.
it can also bring some clients to those designers - promote their work.


=================







Here is a set of different websites that can help you to get a job in a tech company.
They are maybe not very popular right now. Or very local. But there you'll have less competition, so it worse exploring.



If you also want to get more information about working in tech(right now there a lot of changes) - below I put a list of articles, that might be interested for you to read.
