Generator is a huge thing. So maybe details is necessary.


---------
In order to move forward and efficiently forward - we need to define goals for each of 4 current members here.
(Danielle, Ashley, Yan, Arthur). All of us right now focused at nutritional values/calories intake. If each of us will tell about this goals, it will be easy to figure out our next moves.

My goal is: increasing speed and launch my projects/increasing future functinality, that each of us will be able to use. All of our members are here. Maybe format of this forum should evolve later, but for mow I'm happy with current state of this thread. By sharing here all data in ore place I laos want to publish some quick articles on Hackernoon.
That articles can get us an additional visiblity. About my launches.
I have one project for coding school(98% done) just procrastinating to finish it.
Later I plan to launch static food data as package. I think on ProductHunt it will gain some traction, same with this thread.

So I have a team and I have a big amount of unfinished code. But as I see a promise here, I'll finish and release a few modules quickly.

For example, for Yan project a lot of thing is completed. He have opt-repo. And he has an automatical form with calculations.
How for me was interested to collaborate at this project?
How I can help him?

I have 2 un-finished frontend forms. One form related to add recipe to storage. Second is recipe/meal search form with components, that partially completed.
For example, we have food attributes(different type of them) and I have ready SelectField, that ready to display food attributes. Or something else.

I compared different plugins for select field and pick most "nice" to use at our case.
This is a typical problem in web development right now.

For some cases things works, for some - by any different small features -> break everything that convert cool tool into a bad tool for one case.

So I or my team members can quite fast create form Yan, but Using React, and he will be able to use his backend and send his data as he wants.
For me -> I'll be able to finish some of unfinished code/modules and post a completed frontend components and receive an additional attention to this thread.
With this approach I got a real tasks/goal and quality of code will be increased.

Search can be interesting to Ashley as well.
All my projects like chains so when i finish one, I have abilitiers to move next one forward.
But as I see interest in your projects for me - I can change my focus a bit.
