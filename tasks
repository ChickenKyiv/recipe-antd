 Article: Why GitHub is better than any profiles for software engineers



  Article: Practical articles for people, that want to learn or learned and want to sharpen things. like tasks, similar that I create for people that want to learn flexboxes.


  + I have a dump, but working cool for a git+github task for promises, at ES6, tasks after learning Nodejs+express, tasks graphql, React, forms, HTML/CSS, Grids.

Config Generator -- why we comment a few things, methods?
if we don't need them. lets then add and comment more objects. and hide them for next times?

for generator -- we need to create folders for each generated file as well(compare with `src/data`).

filesES5 -- we have very long paths
we should make it less long. we can update to ```var { resolve } = require('path') and make files easy to read again.

Another story. One guy finds me at AngelLIst. We are a bright guy and won Coding Olympiad in Ukraine. I think that he wants to join us, but he was just curious to know about what Ukrainian company doing at AngelList. And here I should mention that he was "talk down" with me.
And it pisses me off a bit. So, I think that I need to share this. I think that coding Olympiads in Ukraine is bullshit.
(Ok, Ok, don't kill me quick, please - it's my opinion). Again, coding, not science Olympiad, like physics, mathematics.
Why? I have a lot of good friends from India. They are bright people and it's an honor to know them. They are popular students at their university.
Why? They took part at Amazon Hackathon and code bots/assistants for Amazon Echo.
They worked on real practical problems. They work in a team and compete at the tough competition. And win. Took first places and get few USD grans at their hands.
Become an Amazon Influencer Students. And it's in 1000 times more important and valuable.
Cooler than our Olympiads. More prestigious as well. They can use their knowledge right now.
They can sell their skills and get a job. Make money. And be able to support their families. Or they can create a company, sell their products.
End of this story. And I'm upset about it. In Ukraine, we have a great STEM education. But at the next steps: buildings worldwide useful products, promote and sell it => we suck.
Hope it will change in the future. Hoping for changes.
