Generator is a huge thing. So maybe details is necessary.

[i wrote this post week ago, just was not able to post it]
In order to move forward and efficiently forward - we need to define goals for each of the 4 current members here.
(Danielle, Ashley, Yan, Arthur). All of us right now focused on nutritional values/calories intake. If each of us will tell about these goals, it will be easy to figure out our next moves.

My goal is: increasing speed and launch my projects/increasing future functionality, that each of us will be able to use. All of our members are here. Maybe the format of this forum should evolve later, but for now, I'm happy with the current state of this thread. By sharing here all data in one place I also want to publish some quick articles on Hackernoon.
That articles can get us additional visibility. About my launches.
I have one project for coding school(98% done) just procrastinating to finish it.
Later I plan to launch static food data as a package. I think on ProductHunt it will gain some traction, same with this thread.

---

So I have a team and I have a big amount of unfinished code. But as I see a promise here, I'll finish and release a few modules quickly.

For example, for Yan project, a lot of things is completed. He has opt-repo. And he has an automatical form with calculations.
How for me was interested to collaborate at this project?
How I can help him?

I have 2 un-finished frontend forms. One form related to add recipe to storage. Second is recipe/meal search form with components, that partially completed.
For example, we have food attributes(different type of them) and I have ready SelectField, that ready to display food attributes. Or something else.

I compared different plugins for select field and pick most "nice" to use at our case.
This is a typical problem in web development right now.

For some cases things works, for some - by any different small features -> break everything that converts the cool tool into a bad tool for one case.

So I or my team members can quite fast create form Yan, but Using React, and he will be able to use his backend and send his data as he wants.
For me -> I'll be able to finish some of unfinished code/modules and post completed frontend components and receive additional attention to this thread.
With this approach, I got real tasks/goal and the quality of code will be increased.

Search can be interesting to Ashley, Alison as well.
All my projects like chains so when I finish one, I have abilities to move next one forward.
But as I see interest in your projects for me - I can change my focus a bit.

Alison, after reading your latest posts i see a similar feedback that I got from different food tech startup founders.
I agree that workflow/approach can be different. But main logic or blocks or structure is a pretty the same.
It's like we have a lot of different cars, one is Tesla, another is truck that moving big weights, or last-mile food delivery vehicle, that is very lightweight and should delivery a warm pizza in 20 minutes.
But all of these cars have engine, wheel, safety airbags, etc. this is what i mean. And this is why i'm not building one project that will solve one problem.
I'm not a pro at this topic, but i can see how split project into small pieces and implement each of it.
You right that logic of picking meals for diabetes and allergies is different. But it's 20% difference max. 80% of foundation is the same. And this is why my approach is a bit different.
instead of make one project and hide my code - i work on engine(server) separately, try different wheels(few coding languages) separately and then plan to connect everything together.
It's also about time and money actually. I mean developer that know how to code different apps and developer that code all time food tech - is to different people. and their value is also different.

For each member that currently here I plan to create a specification and share here. will you be interested to have it?
