Interns 2

I collected some of the basic questions, that I receive from different people, that hears
about my experience with interns. The first part can be found here: []



TITLE;;;;;;;

Be aware, that you cannot wait for immediate results from the beginning of working with not experienced people.
By including intern/interns into your development process(or any) other professional/commercial projects) -> you'll
make your Project Manager busy. I don't like term babysitting, but a lot of control and organization work should be applied in order to have a good time for intern and you.

So if you don't have free time/energy -> it's a bad idea.

If you don't have steal rules or processes set up at your company - > you will just add more chaos into the dish of chaos.
I think you understand my point.

Be ready that an average, it will take about 1-2 months before the intern will learn how to work at your company.
(I mean not coding skills, the whole working process)
Only after that time he/she will be ready to make nice progress on his own, without spending additional time.
(I really sometimes amazed how students learn from me and became independent coding machines)

From what countries I got applications? Are they are local or not?
------------
I got interns from all around the globe.

The "difference" is the main word. I cannot remember all countries, but Asia, Europe, Australia, Africa, and North America was covered.
A lot of different countries and cultures.
One time we have a video chat - 4 people - different places, different accents. it was very fun to chat.

Most fascinating and motivating for me are people from China, India, African countries as Ghana, Kenia, Nigeria(no particular order)

Damn, one of our interns gives birth in the summer. And I was stressed and wait for her message.
I really care about this experience.
it was giving me for some reasons.

Because people that applying to work - want to have a better life and they fighting to succeed.
It's energizing me every time when I think about it.

How to manage interns?
-------
It's hard. You can explain to everyone workflow and rules -> but they will try to abandon them.
Because they don't know how to work and don't feel comfortable with the new approach.

And this is ok, it's normal.

They like to use Messenger and call me a Bro.
And I like to use email. So please be patient, don't nervous.
And wait while they will open their emails and find your message.
What is cool -  they will reply fast(when reading your message).

============
How to search for interns? How to find the right one?
---
I think the basic way to search for skills. But this is a long game of scrolling
You can also view by technical education. You can search for people, that somehow
knowledgeable at some parts of your work.
If a student made a custom course work or complete a "famous course" at Udacity at image recognition software.

He can be a quick choice if you have a similar work to do

(Actually, Udacity has their famous self-driving course, not OCR)
Can help you to reduce the number of interviews.
by applying different methods or custom key searches.

Because it's not the same as the search by "Machine Learning" title and Skill - Python.
It's a very common term.



SHIT
And Yeah, you will need to teach your interns.
Be ready to reply to their simple questions. Or catch them before they will fall into the sea of trouble. At some point, I was bored to reply to default or similar questions and I start to write articles.
I'm mastering my story-telling, in order to give and share the necessary information that I want to share, in a format that interns will be able to understand and use as I want to.






Sometimes, students "get loose" or cut loose.
And later they shy to come back.
+++ You should be ready for this or try to prevent it. +++
My team members are different.
Different cultures, different ages.
People can be active, or passive.
Some people are "developed"!!! (completed and mature) and ready to work. They find their goals.
And tools to archive them.

Some didn't find their way yet.

What is uniting us? Passion for technologies.
They hungry to new stuff as do I.
And they want to learn more.


Also be ready, that some people just want to try. They want to explore how it will work for them. And they can leave you quickly.
And this is fine too.



One more thing!

They ready to chat and explore opportunities.
They ready to try something new, but when the task is not prepared and assigned -> something changes _>
and they have hard times to start it.

This is why they usually asking for the timeframe and you better give them
a deadline or it'll be buried in their heads because it's not easy to start a completely a new "thing"

Like a setup is always a breaking point for a lot of people. because it's always hard to set up and start your project for the first time.
If it will be hard to set up your project - you'll waste that student, in most cases.


Be ready, that they will request an official job-offer, an experience certificate ->
this is an example from my work, for your inspiration or template.

In order to give them more "freedom" and "fun", I created a common Slack channel
But I'm not using it quite often. And this is bad. Because while you didn't give them a lot of attention - they became sad and unmotivated.

So you usually should keep an open-connection with them the whole time.
I have a hard time with this.


----


All these observations came from errors and trials. I'm learning how to manage people better with my students.

So only by learning this. I still prefer to use and create and assign coding tasks at Github.
Also, if I will spend time and invest something by preparing tasks, and this student will "cut loose"
+++++++++++=
My time into task preparation

_> I will have that task, and I can re-assign it anytime to someone else.


Sometimes they get scared by looking at a big repository with 600 commits before they starting
or see a lot of " scary " code   that they didn't understand(same for me, actually)

Usually, I'm not making any feedbacks or assumptions about how exactly new members will give real results or
what about quality or frequency will be. A lot of Devs are mastering
first skills from video tutorials or step-by-step articles.


{and usually spending one time to code something -> didn't mean that they learn it
or can apply this knowledge at the different situation at your project} Debugging process is a king

SO you shouldn't make any assumptions too from the beginning. Just give them some time.
Because people can behave differently and the first expression can be wrong(shit, why we need resumes, then?)
especially in the software development field.

Personal screening, resume review, checking Linkedin profile -> cannot tell (you about how)
 will he/she be able to deliver?
Also, it's always a personal thing. Can the teacher and intern be a good match or not. It's very important



At their age -> profiles in professional networks usually not maintained well. for like 50% cases.
Check Instagram instead!

Summary

Students don't have the experience to show their experience and present themselves.

What is matters for me -> their intentions to learn and WILL to complete the task and figure out how and what to do?
And their ability to adjust. This is just another skill, for working as part of the team.

Usually, a verbal speaking task explanation didn't work well.
What can be as bad as it? Maybe explain what to do in a long chat where other people interacting too.

I prefer to use a text explanation at separated Github Tasks/issues.
Interns should realize that this is their save place.
It's a place, that they owe, where he/she can ask questions and receive answers.

At the first time -> don't share the same task between users?
They will be conflicted.

If an intern stuck or didn't start a task -> then they stuck because of you.
And your work is more complex than you think. You'll never get a real feeling of what is easy to do and what is not).


Usually, it also correlates with time, that they spend with you or another manager before.

After a few months of working together and will be an active participant intern all require time in order to "unfreeze" and feel comfortable.
