Okay, we have client that use my smart-fridge to sell healthy food. example: https://alvo.co/
so, following the idea of nutrition, often the menu has full nutritional info breakdown
we know that iOS have Health-App, and so do Android.
So, in principle, after they buy, what they eat can be exported to the Health app
now they can track their diet on top of tracking their physical activity
What if we build a layer of service to "sell" personalized nutritionist?
Say you would like to follow Keot diet. They choose a certified nutritionist that will help you in your diet. Say what you should cut down and what you should eat
this service is payable (just like when you have personal trainer in gym).
you take a cut from this service
you can connect nutritionist to end-consumer via this platform.
