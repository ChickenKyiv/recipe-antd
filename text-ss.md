in order to compensate some time, that i spend on this article, I need at least 10 different people to clap.
It will boost views of this article by 2-3x. thanks for doing this.

Btw, if someone to try to be my intern(non-paid position) -> buzz me -> it'll be a pleasure for me to teach you. As you see, I'm an open person and can share with you a lot of things.

When you write a letter you can expect only a letter.
Wehn you write an article with a lot of details - it's unbeatable by letters. only same approach can be a game changer.
So if SS decides to reply - do it publicly. and not just by sending links to "rules".

What positive things I find at Skillshare?

1) Support team is very friendly. My support manager spend a lot of time, answering to my questions and advising me. 
( I hope in future they can provide feedback to the top staff, and they can adjust something. )

2) Teaching community are very friendly and active too. I saw a lot of cool courses, related to art & illustrations. 
Very friendly people

3) I finished and published my first course with their help. And I can teach people online! Yay!

Ok, let's jump to my story.
Briefly, I got a bad experience after publishing my course.
This is my list of things, that goes wrong.
1) I think I was mislead*


2) When i raised hard questions, I didn't get a reply, that I can evaluate as satisfying.


3) My course nobody attending after 3 months. **

* Maybe it's not right/correct expression.
I was over sold by messages, how it'll be cool, when I publish my course.
How it'll help to community of people that want to learn how to code.
And how profitable it be.


** Yeah, yeah, i know.

Details below

After main stroy I will share my notes, hacks, observations and conclusions.

By publishing this article I don't want to share hate or my frustration only. I want and hope that I have rights to make my conclusions about this situation with a differect prospections!!!

Or i will became yet another complaining person in social media(Which is not a bad thing at all - to have a voice and provide a REAL feedback)

TIPS

What i learn from this situation?
1) Read everything carefully. Ask any questions that buzzing you. Ask for an explanations.
Or anyone will be able to tell you -> you misunderstood.
Or overestimated an offer. Or just didn't find any hidden term

2) Teaching people is hard. Course creation from scratch is a hell of the process.
For sure - if you working on something, that you never did before -> it's very hard. So any unusual activity will take more time and enegry from you at the begining.

3) Your situation is unique. Unique for you. And nobody cares about it. And when you read about an average level, you need to understand that some one are at above an average level too. (Why I don't remember that? I had A in Math logic. Math is bitch:0 )

So please Welcome me -> I'm above that level on Skillshare platform.

4) Always make a quick turnaround. Don't perfect it in a first time. It will help you to review a result and draw a conclusion: Continue to do it or not.

4.5) Dont' spend a lot of time on course creation. Yes, it is my advice. Especially if it is your first course. You are learning how to teach. And if you spend a week on it and didn't feel that you made a good progress -> then this is a big topic for you at this moment. Step back, calm down and split your course in 3 parts.

Slides creation help me a lot. I use some HTML template with jQuery animations. But right now Github is full of different static website generators. And you can use/store your content in *.md format(Markdown format) and it will generate you a slideshow at build.

---

Should you spend time, preparing detailed course exploration? Details are must have? No, I don't thinks so.
If you really need that boost -> you can trick a system with a spam approach. Start to follow any teachers that you can find. And you should be happy if 1 from 10 persons will follow you back.

Tip for SS managers^ They should start a CRM. I assume that adding Intercom/Zendesk and Hupspot CRM/Salesforce will help a lot. Without a CRM they struggling.
Yes, i notice that just from chat.

Actually they have one email for all enquries. So same letter reading at least few humans. At least I hope for this :)

Another idea to dump coupon with free stuff and ask people online to help you by watching videos on repeat without sound.

I did it (Details sections). Still nothing.
You actually can see that content. I use it in order to create an article [https://medium.com/quick-code/top-tutorials-to-learn-flexboxes-for-frontend-development-d6dfb2113b48]

If you want a quick growth of students - just advertise your course. And it will bring more results rather than catching title, or detailed course description. At least FB ads will help you to target your auditory and you will be able to have a link to course(not to the main website page).

---

I assume that SS managers also get mistaken(so it's mutual). I think that they also test an assumption. 
If i have my loved followers base on Medium -> I'll start to sell my course at every article?
Nah. Only this set of articles will be a good promotion(I think there is no thing as bad promo).
Details about you and your needs.
