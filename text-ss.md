in order to compensate some time, that i spend on this article, I need at least 10 different people to clap.
It will boost views of this article by 2-3x. thanks for doing this.

Btw, if someone to try to be my intern(non-paid position) -> buzz me -> it'll be a pleasure for me to teach you. As you see, I'm an open person and can share with you a lot of things.

When you write a letter you can expect only a letter.
Wehn you write an article with a lot of details - it's unbeatable by letters. only same approach can be a game changer.
So if SS decides to reply - do it publicly. and not just by sending links to "rules".

What positive things I find at Skillshare?

1) Support team is very friendly. My support manager spend a lot of time, answering to my questions and advising me. 
( I hope in future they can provide feedback to the top staff, and they can adjust something. )

2) Teaching community are very friendly and active too. I saw a lot of cool courses, related to art & illustrations. 
Very friendly people

3) I finished and published my first course with their help. And I can teach people online! Yay!

Ok, let's jump to my story.
Briefly, I got a bad experience after publishing my course.
This is my list of things, that goes wrong.
1) I think I was mislead*


2) When i raised hard questions, I didn't get a reply, that I can evaluate as satisfying.


3) My course nobody attending after 3 months. **

* Maybe it's not right/correct expression.
I was over sold by messages, how it'll be cool, when I publish my course.
How it'll help to community of people that want to learn how to code.
And how profitable it be.


** Yeah, yeah, i know.

Details below

After main stroy I will share my notes, hacks, observations and conclusions.

By publishing this article I don't want to share hate or my frustration only. I want and hope that I have rights to make my conclusions about this situation with a differect prospections!!!

Or i will became yet another complaining person in social media(Which is not a bad thing at all - to have a voice and provide a REAL feedback)
