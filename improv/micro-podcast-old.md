Hey, ho! It's Friday - we made it! Let's rock at night, will ya? I'll be pretty happy if you'll give your brain some rest. But don't Netflixing all night, ok?

I'm very excited about today's newsletter â€” a big fan of this topic. I'm not an expert, so the reader's discretion is advised. I am sharing my own experience. 
Today we'll be talking about microservices.

During my career, I only a few times worked on a project that was started from scratch. And it's impacting the way of how I prefer to think, when I'm building something. It's like I'm always a younger brother, that will get used pants of this older subling. There still was a system that was built by other developers before me. Usually, they were smarter, more experienced, and a better fit as developers rather that I :) So I always read code from other people, understand it and learn from it. In those projects, I always need to change or extend something. So debugging and refactoring is my BF.

When it's an ongoing project - you start to see a lot of notice a lot of small problems that help to crash this software frequently.

And you like(trying to play the smart guy in this room): "Hey, why we would not upgrade whole module A, rather than try to add another X, Y, Z into it?"

I remember, while learning Java in the academy, they have something similar to the microservices approach. And they use it pretty often, and I think one of the reasons is: they had a lot of business solutions related to interconnected devices that usually have Java Virtual Machine installed on it. And before we have fragile devices, so you can't just put everything under one roof.

So I start to explore how and Why to use microservices as part of code that I" m working on. Primary reasons are pretty simple too:
they fit perfectly in our modern world.

Even if you're using the monolith approach, you still connecting your project with other services/tools. Also, if it's not a perfect example of microservices, communications now is an essential thing.

Payment gateways, analytics dashboards, mobile devices, advertising - everything is exchanging your data(even when you don't want it)

Times, when you can create a calculation and send it as *.exe file is gone. Deal with it. Another big Yes to using microservices as an approach of creating your architecture - they just cost less.
Less $ for hosting, more comfortable to develop and maintain, easier to test, and update.

I prove it on my skin. While Bootstrapping, I don't have money to hire a great developer to join me. So I opened an internship program and my students helping me to code my project. And you can assume, have a big herd of students at one place is not a very quiet and productive thing at all. Especially with the monolith approach.

They have 0 experience of doing anything :) And they will stuck anything when they will be able. So by splitting code into very simple and independent pieces, I was able to move my project forward.


And Yep, my first server I deployed, related to my project - was on Heroku. Yes, there is always can be other, maybe better choices, but AWS didn't accept my Ukrainian cash card, and Heroku has pretty good tutorials and easy to understand help section. Plus, it has a pretty intuitive interface. Plus, GitHub integration. So it was a perfect match for me.

I listen to their podcast. Heroku is my provider as an indie-hacker. And I have warm feelings for the telecommunication field. My granny has her first job at the phone company. At this time, they need to change wires and stick them to different ports by hand. It was necessary to connect two phone owners by a single line with a few commutators in the middle. I also was a part of a pretty innovative startup eight years ago. At that time, Twillio was not so big. Our tool gives and the ability for C-level managers to plan their da and record message for their team members. Then, our system sends recorded messages by calls in scheduled time. So you can efficiently operate your company with a bunch of people, working in different timezones, for example.
