Naming, Branding, Brand Message...
All of these topics are very important. I don't say they are must-haves when you start in the garage. Yeah, someone recommends, "Fake it, till you make t." But I'm not Jordan Belfort, so I'm against it.

But it's a part of the process of growing and expanding your business. Just pick the right place and time for doing it.

Every big company that you know -> has something special. Colors/slogan/messages are unique, simple, fresh, and catchy.

It's like we have a separate language that we're speaking worldwide. You may not know the Italian language(pasta, pizza, parmesan don't count)
But if you need to find a fashion shop in Milan and you see the brand name, for example, Prada, Gucci, Versace - you'll find it. When you just read those brand names, I'm sure you get colorful pictures. If your brand name doesn't create that association -> you're in trouble.

Brands can connect, even separately. When you a fan of one sports team - sometimes you are forbidden to love another team - because they are rivals.

Even country names are brands.

"Do you plan to visit the USA?"
"I was eating ribs in Texas."
"We drink Tequilla in Mexico."
"Let's smoke a Cuban cigar, shall we?"

A lot of companies, even if they have the same workflow, the same team behind, with the help of rebranding, can reach full potential.

First of all, they start to think about how they are selling their product, what they are selling, how "wrap" your product correctly, and make it more appealing.

Yes, it's marketing. People will buy an average product, because of masterly advertising or catchy title.

Xerox is a company, not the name of a machine. But a lot of people use it as an adverb right now. (The device itself is called copier, in case you don't know)

Let's talk about my friends, Pizdata Inc; they have a very catchy name for Russian natives. It's partially swearing, that's why not many people have the courage to have a similar company name. And it's funny and even prohibited. Also, it's simple and draws attention by tricking you.

Because if you want to open a dancing studio and you put in your brand name such words as "salsa, tango, dance" - > it's not unique or catchy at all. There are tons of companies with a similar logo, name, and service.

If you want to build something local - don't waste your time on "branding package." Open Google Maps, pick any country or town you want, and find some of their businesses. Copying it will save you tons of time. And you will see what works in real life.

Being unique is cool, but also, please think about the un-fancy hardcore side of your business: cash flow, sales, core value, customer satisfaction.

Neither the cool logo nor fancy flyer can save you from failure if you don't meet your ends or disappoint your clients.

This is why I love an online way of creating new businesses. It's different from starting at a physical place. It is much easier to grow. Less regulated as well.

What do you prefer: running around with your head off, or just lay down on a comfy couch and type messages? What do you like more? Tell me...

And online services are evolving. A lot of automatization nowadays. Imagine default day of local business: you put an ad in the local paper or google ads. People are calling you when they want, and you need to respond, or you can lose your client.

Then your 0.9 clients (because he hasn't paid you anything yet) comes to your office, eats some welcome cookies, and takes some of your time. 

OR, you sit down with other shareholders and slowly highlight everything that might be important to your client. What do your clients usually ask what they want?

Then you put that information into the knowledge base. Then you connect chatbot to your knowledge base, and it will autoreply and filter most of the clients that are not ready yet to pay or should discuss it with their wife.

Don't waste your time. Don't upset us. Do online businesses. Your children will thank you after(if we don't get any solar burst).
