Naming, Branding, Brand Message...
All of these topics are very important. I don't say they must-have when you start in the garage. Yeah, someone advises, "Fake it, till you make t." But I'm not a Jordan Belfort, so I'm against it.

But it's a part of the process of growing and expanding your business. Just pick the right place and time for doing it.

Every big company that you know -> have something special. Colors/slogan/messages are unique, simple, fresh, and catchy.

It's like we have a separate language that we're talking about worldwide. You may don't know the Italian language(pasta, pizza, parmesan didn't count)
But if you need to find a fashion shop in Milan and you see the brand name, for example, Prada, Gucci, Versace -  you'll find it. When you just read those brand names, I'm sure you get colorful pictures. If your brand name didn't create that association -> you're in trouble.


Brands can connect, even separate. When you a fan of one sports team - sometimes you are forbidden to love another team - because they are nemesis.

Even country names are brands.

"Do you plan to visit the USA?"
"I was eating ribs in Texas."
"We drink Tequilla in Mexico."
"Let's smoke a Cuban cigar, shall we?"

A lot of companies, even if they have the same workflow, the same team behind, by applying to rebrand, can archive a lot of potential.

First of all, they start to think about how they are selling their product, what they are selling, how correctly "wrap" your product, to make it more appealing.


Yes, it's marketing. Even having not an ideal product -> people can buy it, because of sticky advertising or catchy title.

Xerox is a company, not the name of a machine. But a lot of people using it as adverb right now. (machine called copier, if you don't know)

Let's talk about my friends, Pizdata Inc; they have a very catchy name for people that speaking the Russian language. Because it's partially swearing, and not a lot of people have the courage to have a similar company name. And it's funny and even prohibited. Also, it's simple and generates attention by tricking your attention.

Because if you want to open a dancing studio and you put in your brand "salsa, tango, dance" - > it's not unique or catchy at all. There tons of companies with a similar logo, name, and service.

If you want to build something local - don't waste your time on "branding package." Open Google Maps, pick any country or town you want, and find some of their businesses. It will save you tons of time. And you will see what is works in real life.

Being unique is cool, but also, please think about the un-fancy hardcore side of your business: cash flow, sales, core value, customer satisfaction.

Cool logo nor fancy flyer couldn't save you from failing if you don't meet your ends or disappoint your clients.

This is why I love an online way of creating new businesses. It's far away from starting at a physical place. Much easier to grow. Less regulated as well.

What do you prefer: doing something by legs, or just laying down in the comfy sofa and typing messages? What do you like more? Tell me...

And online services are evolving. A lot of automatization nowadays. Imagine default day of local business: you put an ad in the local paper or google ads. Someone is calling you when they want, and you need to respond, or you can lose your client.



Then your 0.9 clients (because he didn't pay you anything yet) came to your office, eat some welcome cookies and take some of your time. OR, you sit down with other shareholders and slowly highlight everything that might be important to your client. What your clients usually ask what they want?

Then you put that information into the knowledge base. Then you connect chatbot to your knowledge base, and he will receive autoreply and filter most of the clients that not ready yet to pay or should chat with their wife.

Don't waste your time. Don't upset us. Do online businesses. Your children will thank you after(if we don't get any solar burst).
