Coding education system is broken in my country.
There is a very low chance to get hired, after completing just a university. It is maybe fine, but youngsters have very tought times. So, topics that I can elaborate at A4 list each.

* IT Step Academy block story
* Different outsourcing companies entertain people at our local colleges(story of how i chat with teachers from Pavlograd college)
* After begining of our war with Russia, it was a "movement" that IT people will help refuges to get a job in tech(part of the story of how my aunt was not able to land a low entry job with 2 degrees, skills of working as teacher for developers and readiness to work, but rejected by age(~40))
* Recruiting process issues(companies are growing and evolving, but workflow are old and not managemeble.)It can be managemeble, but people don't want to make changes and prefer comforting old reading CV stuff.
* Nobody(ok, bad way to put it without numbers) wants to hire a small developers and raise them. Because lifetime of developer at one company is 18 max. Usually it's lower. So it's cheaper and easier for a company to re-hire(steal employee) quickly, whne a new rich client will be able to pay as much as that employee want.

* Aging shit & Sexism
* Story about one of the "Fathers" of software development companies owners was picked as main Principe at college.
He started to change a defualt education process inside of that college to be profitable for all sides. He hired more expereienced developers as teachers, fire old teachers that don't know english or coding, fundraise money from companies and make a building repair so it start to look inspiring, install new PC stands, create a new opportunities for hiring entry-level students. He also clean up a students line, lazy people get fired. nephew of my partner goes fired from it and siwtched into military education because he was lazy to learn coding.

** next part of this story. - Then he was voted to become a main principal in Kharkiv Tech Universite(Place where I was fired 2 times). First time I was bored and for the 2nd time I have an argue with teacher about databases explanation at Wikipedia.
So he was promoted to be Top 5-10 principals in tech Universities in Ukraine. Sure thing, he started doing the same thing there. Fire people, raise salaries, hire more young teachers. It was a year when this university moves with a big steps forward. Then he got a huge strike back from an old system that find a legal way to fire him.

* Huge migration of employees between companies. Hire/Re-hire/counter-offers and jumping between jobs is a reality here. Small increase in salary will force an employee to leave an ongoing-project... Only if your company is smart enough to bound you with a really complex contact, NDAs, etc - that will preventing you from jumping - but it goes to a slavery side pretty quickly as well.

* People get fired, while attending previous jobs for meeting old collegues(How suspicious, Huh, let;s fire him, he want to jump back to that company.) BUT he did it in his spare time. WTF.

* Story of my friend/designer. She was scared to look for a new job at Linkedin because she have a small kid that she want to feed and don't want to be fired with bad review...
It actually keep her on the same place for 4 years.

* People got tired to work at this stressful environment and crazy tempo, and don't have faith with their abilities. They have more feature outside and they migrate to a nice country, that treats their skills better. Rather than become a leader at their current companies and make more money.

* small companies are really dying, they cannon sustain a time of 10 years(it's ma story and other companies, that cannot evolve into a big company without adaptation to a new realities of outsourcing market rules).

* Story of how my friend have a lot of test assesments done. And nobody care to look at them, everyone want to spend his time on their own "custom"(copy-pasted from StackOverflow) test. So he have a nice GitHub account - nobody cares, because it will require to change their habits and old processes. He didn't receive a proper feedback from a recruiter, so he asked her publicly(she was an employee at first 10 big companies each has > 800 employees). He did it at Linkedin. She and her leader goes crazy and be upset with a fact that he made it publicly. That post received a lot of attention - 8k views. it's a huge numbers for local Linkedin community. People tried to silence him, advising that this post can make a problems for him...
* Huge story was when outsourcing made a BlackLists of developers. when this story was droped to the public, it was like BlackListGate.
