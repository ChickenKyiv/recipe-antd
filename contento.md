Beauty(at least I see it in this way) of my technilac approach -  of coding project at mu company really helping me with using limited employee resourcess(interns with small coding experience).

It helping me in future as well --> because I'll be able to hire less experienced developers full-time. From one side - teams might have different small chunks of knowledge in coding and still be able to move our code forward.

From the other side --> small skilled(experienced) team members create a lot of problems with reviewing code and control of what team actually doing. But, it also diversity a type of employees, that can be inside at our team. There needs to have a PM, testers and project leaders, that can make decisions and apply code changes.
Leader will create new tasks, partially together with PM and actually watch for the progress.

But right now I don't  necessary required to hire a Senior developers. In my country, salary for developer with 5-8 years of experience ~ $3500(can be more, depending on hype around technologies). It's a developer that worked before in large projects and companies.

At the current stage of our project - it will be enough to hire a few middle developers(1-2 years) and each of teams, working full time, separated by working on different modules will be able to do and ship small projects/modules in a few months.

There is also a small price for errors. Nothing big actually. Nothing complex are inside. That can go broken and freeze a whole development process right now are removed.

With help of a few project managers and people, that can help me with a process or totally replace me from creating/managing tasks or creating a development tech specification - it will give teams ability to work in a more simple and organized process.
That process will be more crystal clear for developers, and for us --> team managers, that looking for the whole picture.

It also improve processes. And increase tech value of things that we are doing. Like if junior develoer can understand the complex structure, that we building. It's great in overall, right? It;s improves our coding workflow, because we like always testing our modules, it's structure with other people and see where they stuck or not. If someone stuck - "Ok dude, you maybe don't trying hard to understand it". If 10 people have a hard time --> it's a good indicator that we should focus on documentation --> because it's really our problem here.

it's also simplifying things like estimates, deadlines, releases planning. With a simple code, it's easier to find what was went broken and quickly fix it. Less number of bottlenecks and pauses to wait, "when X will be fixed, then it'll be enable to solve issue with Y, and in mean time, Y cannot work, and it's a blocked by X and we cannot solve it right now"   

More people can archive more progress nad in short amount of time.
Let's crack previous sentence with an example.
We have simple module, where a few interns working on. They are young, small, making mistakes. I decided to jump into that module, and ship a "big update". I'm working separately, so my changes can't affect interns work.
One week passed and I see this message --> They made more commits than I did for the same amount of time. And why I should be thinking that i'm better, because I'm experienced. yes, commit numbers is not a best tool for measure progress. it's debatable. but it's a good indicator of how it work for us. Few students, that interested to learn coding -> made more small improvements, that can do unmanageble "expert" like myself.
