Localization, globalization, internationalization - do these words sound a bit the same to you?
A lot of people think like that.
Our goal with this newsletter is to understand the differences and find the way to "spread tech to global markets".
I'll be happy if my knowledge will help to share the message of your brand globally.

GILT(globalization, internationalization, localization, Translation) - all these things are business activities for me.
And yes, they should be incorporated into online projects.
Why? Because Internet is shifting borders and giving to people that thinking about the big picture, since there are a lot of opportunities.
There are tons of examples, when a product, that was selling not well locally, goes wild at some other country. Usually, it happens unintentionally. But smart companies can aim for this piece of a pie. Because money never sleeps and speaks different languages.
If you can't find investments in the US, you may try to launch your product in China, India or OAE.
 
The simple game went viral in Turkey only because they had a hard political race and this game adapted to this situation and introduced 2 teams, named after different parties.

One social network failed locally 8years ago but works awesome in developing countries in Africa. They have found the way to fight local con-artists with fake profiles.

One Math teacher gets > 70% of his money from India because his content and study program have been optimized to mobile devices. And due to the lack of local teachers - he is rocking there.

I think Netflix is a pretty good example of GILT incorporation. They offer different local content. It works in 190 countries. So by using Netflix, you get into some sort of a local bubble(install VPN and check it yourself). They provide translated & adapted subtitles. Netflix UI is also localized.

I think everyone should pursue i10n as part of their business strategy. Because you don't know where you may go viral. It's a very wise move, trust me. But yes, shifting to different markets is not an easy thing.

It may require subject-matter experts, tech experts and people with "international skills".
 
Our case here is related to software and hardware related products. So our important targets will be data encoding(ASCII will work fine in Europe, USA, but perform badly on Ukrainian or Chinese market).

About hardware. It may sound crazy, especially when we all know a lot of worldwide brands, like Apple, Cisco, Samsung. But there can be a lot of situations, where you just can't get some type of a chip locally, especially quickly.

This is one of the reasons why my friend owns 1/6 of a yacht. He is pretty good at Chinese electronics. He builds custom solutions: when it has 0 documentation on English, nobody knows how it works until he has not broken a few of them. Then when he’s found out how it works he creates custom code in Assembler.

About UI. If your project needs to support different languages - your elements should be able to stretch at least.

Localization is hard, especially if you don't have native team members that can point at your mistakes. 
hint: Don't try to tackle project localization by Google Translate. But one of our authors actually uses Google Spreadsheets functions to translate short labels.

Let's quickly mention problems related to going globally.
naming conventions - this part varies even in different professions
[meme about models.]

phone formats, date format, writing direction, measurements, punctuation styles, local legal abbreviations.

if you are doing a project in different langs - please plan out it from the beginning. And tell it to your dev team as well.
Yes, there are a lot of cool libraries online or database schemes that you can just copy-paste and it MAY work, but without proper planning - you are doomed or at least will lose more money.

Proper i10n is a very good perk, especially when you are pitching investors. They know something, don’t they?

Getting complete localization or translation can be tricky [sponsor plug]

IF you are still telling yourself - my project is different and I don't want to deal with it right now. I'll just stick with English right now, you should know that 75% of surveyed users love to purchase stuff online when they can read the product description on their local language.

Even the online help section needs to be translated into different languages. I'm sure, most small companies don't worry about it.

Again, by localizing your product, you can reach more SALES.

If it's not enough, then what if you could help more people with your product?
Change lives globally!

That`s all from me.
