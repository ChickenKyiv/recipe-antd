Localization, globalization, internationalization - sounds pretty similar to you?
A lot of people think like you.
Our goal with this newsletter to understand differences and find a way to "spread tech to global markets". 
I'll be happy if my knowledge will help to share your brand message globally.

GILT(globalization, internationalization, localization, Translation) - for me all these things are business activities.
And yes, they should be incorporated into online projects.
Why? because Internet shifting borders and giving to people, that thinking in the big picture - a lot of opportunities.
There are tons of examples, when a product, that was performing poorly locally, goes wild at some other country. Usually, it happens without intention. But smart companies can aim for this part of a pie. Because money never sleeps and talks on different languages.
If you can't find investments in the US, you may try to pitch your product in China, India or OAE.

The simple game went viral in Turkey only because they have a hard political race and this game adapt to this situation and introduce 2 teams, named by different parties.

One social network failed locally 8years ago but works awesome in developing countries in Africa. They just find a way to fight local con-artists with fake profiles.

One Math teacher gets > 70% of his money from India because his content and study program optimized to mobile devices. And due to lack of local teachers - he kicking ass there.

I think Netflix is a pretty good example of GILT incorporation. They offering different local content. Working in 190 countries. So by using Netflix, you get into some sort of local bubble(install VPN and check it on your own) They provide translated & adapted subtitles. Netflix UI also localized.

I think everyone should pursue i10n as part of their business strategy. Because you don't know where you'll viral. It's a very wise move, trust me. But yes, going to different markets is not an easy thing. 

It may require subject-matter experts, tech experts and people with "international skills".

Our case here related to software and hardware related products. So our important targets will be data encoding(ASCII will work fine in Europe, USA, but perform badly in Ukrainian or Chinese market).

About hardware. It may sound crazy, especially when we all know a lot of worldwide brands, like Apple, Cisco, Samsung. But there a lot of situations, where you just can't get some sort of chip locally, especially quickly. 

This is one of the reasons why my friend owns 1/6 of a yacht. He is pretty good at Chinese electronics. He builds custom solutions: when it has 0 documentation on English, nobody knows how it works while he did not break a few of them. Then he knows how it works he creates custom code in Assembler. 

About UI. If your project needs to support different languages - your elements should be able to stretch at least.

Localization is hard, especially if you don't have native team members that can point you to your mistakes.

hint: Don't try to tackle project localization by Google Translate. But one of our authors actually uses Google Spreadsheets functions to translate short labels.

Let's quickly mention problems related to going globally.
naming conventions - this part varies even by different professions
[meme about models.]

phone formats, date format, writing direction, measurements, punctuation styles, local legal abbreviations.

if you doing a project on different langs - please plan it from the beginning. And tell it to your dev team as well.
Yes, there a lot of cool libraries online or database schemes that you can just copy-paste and it MAY work, but without proper planning - you doomed or at least will burn more money.

Proper i10n is a very good perk, especially when you pitching investors. They know something, do they?

Getting complete localization or translation can be tricky [sponsor plug]

IF you still telling yourself - my project is different and I don't want to deal with it right now. I'll just stick with English right now, you should know that 75% of surveyed users love to purchase stuff online when they can read the product description on their local language.

Even the online help section needs to be translated into different languages. I'm sure, most small companies don't worry about it.

Again, by localizing your product, you can reach more SALES.

If it's not enough? Then what if you can help more people with your product? 
Change lives globally!

That`s all from me.
