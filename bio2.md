Resume

1) worked as PHP Dev, learn how to use Bootstrap - 2012 year
2) Managed my own company. We provided an outsourced software development services for 4-5 years.
3) Failed it. We run out of money and close it. But we have pending work from our clients to do. In 9 months we completed with my partner 2 projects that we owe to our clients. basically for free.
4) Right now I'm building my own startup and formed a team of interns, that want to gain experience in real startup. As interns have usually limited real knowledge, I teaching them. Not just languages, but how to code better, how to use a different packages/libraries, etc.

At this moment I have at least 18 people in a process. They learn backend, frontend. Some of them will quit and didn't finish the course, for sure.



Backend development we're learning by using Loopback API Framework(backed by IBM) - with nodeJS/expressJS inside.



React for frontend - I find a cool and simple course on Medium. I've extended it, add some tests, and teaching people it steps by step and track their progress at Github. So they also learn how to use Git, how to use pull requests, etc. And how to communicate - it's important for developers too.

Maybe later we'll also master a React Native because the basics are the same as at React.

One girl told me that she wants to learn more about creating databases - so we're chatting about feature releases and what we need to do in order to make DB structure better, easy and stable. So it's like a third topic that I'm teaching - DB architecture.


Another motivation goal is my wish to share my experience. Because I wear a lot of different hats in the previous company - and some of my experience is unique.



About starting to work together.
I can tell "Yes why not", but later things can change... I'm interested to understand how hard I'll be connected to your company? What did I need to do if I decide to quit? or when a course is created once -> I will not spend a lot of time?
It's important for me because later I can have a small amount of time. So it's better to discuss from start.

Do you have some KPIs for my work?

My weaknesses:
* I can be busy
* I can be stuck at something - like creating this email :)
* I have skills in English speaking, but it's not perfect. English is not my native language,  I think I'll need some content proof-read/ reviewing of my content - before publishing.



BUT, I spend a lot of time by teaching people,  I think this will not be a big problem(i can be wrong, for sure :)).


My main goal, when I teach my interns is to include them later in my projects. So they can help me with my ongoing coding tasks. Can you tell me - is this possible to create a learning programme(practice part), when I can use hands of my students inside my projects?




Money is not the main motivation for me right now. But if I'll be able to make a few bucks, it'll be great. because I spend all my time at my projects and don't work anywhere. And my project is not generating a revenue at this moment.



Fun note. My aunt is a coding teacher, and 0.5 years ago I saw the main teaching plan, related to javascript language. And I forced her to rewrite it from scratch, by using my help, of course. We decided to put more attention to jQuery and animations, and students like it because they are children.




In my prev company, I teach my employees WordPress, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. I proud that my two best friends used my help. And when they learned the basics - they were hired at good outsourcing companies in Ukraine. Frontend developer position.





Right now my students/interns/juniors are weak. And a lot of them not ready to be included in real projects, so I decided to create separate repositories, where I can work personally with each member. In the beginning, they learn via basic tutorials, and when they're ready - I gave them small real tasks. This is how we manage the workflow.





You can see these tutorial repositories at Github. We didn't hide anything, so feel free and read how we communicate inside our team.

Answers to your questions
Would you be interested in teaching:
a class on CSS - Yes, I can do this, just need to think about the plan. I have a presentation, related to Flexbox, we did it with my friend because in his office a lot of people didn't know about it. I also can think about Bootstrap 4 - because I'm a big fan of it.
HTML - maybe, it's not hard
Git - I think it should have 2 topics Git + GitHub. And it's more about practice. Because I saw that a lot of my interns know Git basics, but never broke any repositories before. So it should be focused on practice class, in my opinion.
Javascript/jQuery, SASS - yep, we can do basics. SASS is also can be mixed with Bootstrap - because you can teach about how to create a good elements structure by showing samples of Bootstrap modules.
Node.JS - tell me what exactly do you want to have? simple CRUD+mongodb, or creating APIs? right now I'm exploring how to create an npm package, so this can be another class too.
React.JS - only basics. nothing advanced, because I'm mastering it right now too.

I'll work on my ideas, but want to focus on one topic at first. When I'll have some additional ideas - I'll share this list with you.
I think most hard for me will be a filming part.
