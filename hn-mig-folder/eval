1. Are you happy? 

Yes. Can be tired, but overall i’m pretty happy to work here. No jokes.
Big opportunity for me and a valuable skill set I'm advancing right now. 
Especially learning from David. How he thinks.
ok, funny part - did you see a happy elephant - this is how i feel :)




2. What work project/s are you most proud of it 2019?

I catch your attention and join HN :)
I like that we start to publish more newsletters and have steady growth
 in the number of published stories per week.
We start process of solving face-img issue.
 
 
 
 
3. What metric/s and milestone/s demonstrate your value to the company?


Number of stories published + mistakes that i’m making each week(at least one mistake per week). 
Mistakes showing me holes in our processes and i’m trying to fill them, so other new 
editors will not face them(hopefully)





4. What do you wish you did a better job of in 2019?

Push more of my ideas to life. I mean not just generate features in slack, but take more action and make it work. But my ownership bar is rasing. Feeling good about it.





5. Which job responsibilities/tasks do you enjoy most? Which do you least enjoy?

Reading/editing good stories is a perfect part of editorial job. 
I don’t know for the most part of working with you I was trained, so 
But it’ll be cool to be less separated with dev team.

Newsletters are not easy for me. But I like doing them. 
It's a good opportunity to share my opinion with such many people and it's priceless.
I don't like to publish stories in a rush when the author is pushing us.







6. How do you want your role to evolve in 2020, 2021 and 2022? 

2020.
I want to find a way to increase the number of stories published + help developers.

If we also find an automatic way how to bring a stable number of new authors(so we know that we spend X it will get us Y new articles) - will be awesome. 
We can make it work.
 
2021.
I’m leading team of editors and we totally remove David from ed operations(Only if he wish)

2022.
We should aim at something big and hard. Because 2 years is a lot. 
So maybe: 
- put all my fav YouTube bloggers on HN
- Try to overgrow futurism.com 
- Be a default choice for publishing/republishing some documentation that people keeping on GitHub and if someone has a cool code project located on GitHub - we should be a place to share information/progress...
I.e. HN should be the default way to promote your project for the developers' community.





7. What metrics or milestones do you want the company prioritize as a whole? 





8. Which metrics or milestones should the company prioritize as measuring the value you add?





9. What type of projects would you like to spend more time on? 

I want to find a way of recruiting authors without being a robot that replying with default messages.
When I see similar questions - I usually share our help section or articles, but maybe it's better to have more personal and long conversations.
I decide to make it in a quick way because nobody guarantees us a lot of stories right now.





10. How can the company better support and drive your long term career goals? 





11. What additional work benefits would help you do a better job?

I'm imagining virtual assistant that helps us, keeps logs on my & Utsav tasks(maybe for other members as well) and helps us to be more productive.

As I'm, submitting this document in very very last time - I know about Utsav promotion.
So I think it's a good time to think about preparing a separate person that will help him to curate the crypto section.
Because we can't clone Utsav :) I think we can do it with an intern that will Utsav pick and raise.





12. What additional company wide work benefits should the company prioritize?

Sometimes I think we should have some sort, part-time advisors, from the outside that can help us.
Even Jay, as he is not part of our crazy cycles can help us. But maybe it'll be better to have someone who costs a lot and it will force us to listen to him.
It can push us forward. For sure, the team will not be happy for the first time, because we'll be breaking our current processes. But for the company, it can be an evolutionary step forward.
How I see it: someone spends with us 1-week max. We can run it each 3 months period.
In 1 week this person provides to our C-levels some sort of document-review. Later we talk about it together and try to apply that feedback in a short amount of time.
Main idea is to make changes quickly and grow drastically.






13. How do you want your compensation to change in 2019 and 2020? 
I’m pretty fine with our current contract. I’ll do the same editing work(maybe less focused) for smaller amount. If you want to increase my hr - we can set some milestones

Like you, Arthur should do x,y,z and we do A.





14. What can you to be more helpful to your teammates? 





15. What can your teammates do to be more helpful to you?





16. What (if any) concerns do you have when it comes to giving the company feedback? How can we alleviate those concerns?





17. What skills/talents/perspectives/abilities of yours is the company underutilizing? 
Project management. As coder/frontend developer/PM - I can at least check current code and tell that it should be improved.
We actually do it, but slowly. I see more potential in us.






18. What’s the one change you’d advocate for to improve the entire team’s productivity? 
Planning + less freedom = more goals can be completed

We actually do it, but slowly. I see more potential in us, when we organized and try to "beat giant" together. especially latest tasks, that I was involved showing me that working more closer together we're really kicking asses.






19. What should we prioritize to increase the likelihood we reach our potential a company?


Book TopNav Ads for the whole year, focus on Next Sales opportunity.






20. What should you prioritize to increase the likelihood you reach your potential as a professional? 

English skills, get to my optimal performance, have plans for 2 weeks forward and just do it, instead of being fireman :)










----------------

I like an idea to move forwrd and grow with authors that not give up on us, but I also want to share, get eyeballs to old stories.
A lot of stories still rocks, relevand and not outdated.
For me, it's like a gold mine, that we decide not to use at this moment, due to shortage of our resources.


We should achieve more views count soon. As we now separated and independent, nobody will cannibalaize our views/users from us.
How we can get more quickly? Not sure, but it's one of my goals. Editing/publishing new stories is just repetitive process that moving us forward.


I was raised as manager in a very competitive place. We often have limited budget/resources and deadlines was pretty tight.
Another thing - each project give us a review. So we were forced to innovate or try diffrent risky things - without them we just can't make profit.
So I want to use that my knowledge for Hackernoon benefits.




I also want to help our dev team somehow. If i can make their life easier - it'll be perfect. They struggle and this is not their fault.
I'm sure if we tweak their work, organize - it'll get us some boost. Before it was not our main focus - but now I think it should be.



Code Modularity is our weak point. Bottleneck + hole where we're losing time/money/energy

-------



- as money our priority => we should optimize current processes and get more juice from it. especially with repetitive things.



Help to increase money spending. It's more complex than it's sounds from the first sentence.
I think it will energize us and make us more competitive. Because we have a lot of ideas and we should start to try them...




Find a way to apply good dev practices into our process and limit the time that we need to ship something.
Don't try to put salt on an open wound, but we all know we need more dev powers.




Yes, We need/must have a better testing process and maybe now my idea of hiring DevOps that I share with David 6-8 months ago can do even more cool things for us.





Maybe even lead some developers from Ukraine(I don't want to do it, but it's in my blood, so...)




Move Open source ideas forward(i mean our for code). Part of my plan related to the separation of our code.
I have a lot of ideas about it. Write it a few times on Slack, but we always busy to really start it because it's a low priority at this moment.





Help not to think that HN is smaller than The Next Web or TC.
