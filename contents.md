One of the goals of this course: I see how my interns know how to code, but they have troubles to jump into our workflow.

I'm a bit proud of it - because i spend a lot of time to setup it and test with a reeal students.

But they know only about commits and repositories. But they have problems at the begining of the whole collaboration process. Like they usually code on their own, and put code on their repositories.

So it's crucila for me to have a place with links, where I can share things.

PRs is hard, changes in PRs hard, commiting frequently is hard as well, code merge conflicts are scarying them as fuck :)

I even don't talk about appying git-flow, using good PR descriptions, adding tasks to PRs or chose tasks with commit messages .

And it's only a problem for newbies, entry level developers.
A lot of people don't know or lazy to use it.
so it's win-win for few things that i'm working on. it's improving our coding process - developers learn more a real

When I'm thinking about investor, I don't see it like a fool, without tech knowledge, but with money. That can be tricked.
I saw a lot of situations when people borrow money for "company growth". And it was a C-management salary growth. I'm seeing investor like a strategic thinking professional, wolf, that smelling money in what i'm doing. So I think i'm looking for "smart money". So he will be able to understand what and how i'm doing my products. And with his help we can do everything quickly.
Cash can help us to hire a few developers and
- speed up our development at least for 4 months(saving time and my brain)
- cah help us with sales process. maybe can help with pre-sales, find a future client, that can be interested of what we are doing.

So my goal is not move all risks to investor shoulders. I don't want to get a "competitive salary" for myself.
But I want to find a pro that can be my ally, that can help us to perfect this idea, so we can move from "big idea and don't finished a lot of code" -> to "get working project, that ready to be used by users and can generate a revenue"

For example, by using network or money, or by speeding up a content marketing process, so more people can hear or just can have a similar project. And my code can help to his project or team with my skills. So money not just for spending them, but for saving time and simplify development and releases process.

QUESTION.
Difference between this question and how I collaborate with a few members and provoke a discussion.
"How you will solve this: instead of doing a big cahnge, that is hard to do (imposible to do quickly) it yourself" --> how you will explain the same big task and you are just an observer of this task.
Like a Project Manager, that can reply to questions but you don't touch an exact code.

Other people can be less experienced than you, or have a less time spend working with us/ don't understand the whole codebase.

Then you, will need to solve task by explaining how to comple this task.

TO make the process is more predictable and less buggy small changes steps. that is easy to manage.

You will need to spend time and create a detailed step by step plan that can be digestable by all member,s with different skillsets.

Then I'm asking this: "are you really really sure, that plan that you created will be enough to do it by other interns?"

Yeah, I'm scarying my developer with this question a bit. And he should (I hope for it)
be forced to re-read the whole task description and conversations again and try to think about it again. Wrapping his head around it is very helpful.
It's eliminates errors, confusion, time for trying different things. That other developers can spend and also help to master skills of planning his work(how to do code, without making a code)
It help to master collaboration skills --> you asking more questionns. Split biggest parts into a small parts, clarify process and help to Plan your time/deadlines, which is also important skill for developers. He can re-imagine the whole process of doing this task at pseudo-code logic. I think it's importent to doing with my team members, not only code together.
