One of the goals of this course: I see how my interns know how to code, but they have troubles to jump into our coding workflow.

I'm a bit proud of our workflow - because I spend a lot of time to set it up and test with real people.

But they know only about commits and repositories. But they have problems at the beginning of the whole collaboration process. Like they usually code on their own and put the code on their repositories.

So it's crucial for me to have a place with links, where I can share things related to git/GitHub features.

Where I see my own students stuck(And we can a nice process of "loosing" lazy/busy people)
- PRs is hard
- changes in PRs hard
- committing frequently is hard as well
- merge conflicts at code are scaring them as fuck :)

I even don't talk about applying git-flow, using good PR descriptions, adding tasks to PRs or chose tasks with commit messages. I hope I'll implement it in the future at mass numbers.

And it's not only a problem for newbies, entry-level developers.
A lot of people don't know or lazy to use it. I saw an example nowadays. My friend started to play a game and find a new job = he received a test assessment. And he is experienced. Like experienced. But as nobody watching him - he drops all un-necessary things and commits his only once - when he finishes test assessment. So how we can judge students that learn to code if people with 4 years lazy to do important things like code tracking.

So it's win-win for a few things that I'm working on.
1) it's improving our coding process
2) developers learn more real work skills
3) I hope this my approach will help to start to make money for the 3 years
4) it's improving the value for my school project - because I can show people more of my teaching work and they will be easily convinced to join us.
5) re-reading and teaching a bunch of articles about git is also improving my own skills as a developer. actually - I was a bad developer before I started my prev. company. So it also adding points to my working process too :)

When I'm thinking about an investor, I don't see him as a fool, without tech knowledge, but with money. That can be tricked. (Yes, a lot of people actually thinking that way, no jokes. Even investors)

I saw a lot of situations when people borrowed money for "company growth". And it was a C-management salary growth. I'm seeing investor like a strategic thinking professional, wolf, that smelling money in what I'm doing. So I think I'm looking for "smart money". So he will be able to understand what and how I'm doing my products. And with his help, we can do everything quickly.

Cash can help us to hire a few developers and
- speed up our development at least for 4 months(saving time and my brain)
- can help us with the sales process. maybe can help with pre-sales, find a future client, that can be interested in what we are doing.

So my goal is not to move all risks to investor's shoulders.
I don't want to get a "competitive salary" for myself. I can accept some money for my own, but I wouldn't try to price myself like a golden founder.

I actually want to find a pro that can be my ally, that can help us to perfect this idea, so we can move from "big idea and don't finish a lot of code" -> to "get a working project, that ready to be used by users and can generate a revenue".

For example, by using a network or money, or by speeding up a content marketing process, so more people can hear or just can have a similar project. And my code can help to his project or team with my skills. So money not just for spending them, but for saving time and simplify development and releases process.

How I'm teaching.

When I feel that my developer/student/intern ready for more - I'm giving him a huge but interesting task. But before starting to work on this task - I'm asking to spend a few hours and think about how he/she will do this task. Like, create 5-10 sentences or questions. When he did that quickly - because of he like a hound - ready to jump into a code - I'm requesting to add more details.
When we spend an additional 10 minutes I'm giving him another work.

You need to get feeling in the difference between "Create a plan how you'll do a complex task yourself" and the next problem that he should solve. The main idea of doing it - set up the biggest bond and collaborate more closely. It provoking discussion, instead of just sitting and reading code.

This is the next question that I'm asking:
"How you will solve this: instead of doing a big change, that is hard to do (impossible to do quickly) it yourself" --> how you will explain the same big task to other developers and you are just an observer of this task.
Like a Project Manager, that can reply to questions but you don't touch an exact code.

Other people can be less experienced than you or have less time to spend working with us/ don't understand the whole codebase.

Then you will need to solve a task by explaining how to complete this task.

To make the process is more predictable and less buggy small changes steps. that is easy to manage.

You will need to spend time and create a detailed step by step plan that can be digestible by all member,s with different skillsets.

Then I'm asking this: "are you really really sure, that plan that you created will be enough to do it by other interns?"

Yeah, I'm scaring my developer with this question a bit. And he should (I hope for it)
be forced to re-read the whole task description and conversations again and try to think about it again. Wrapping his head around it is very helpful.
It eliminates errors, confusion, time for trying different things. Those other developers can spend and also help to master skills of planning his work(how to do code, without making a code)
It helps to master collaboration skills --> you asking more questions. Split biggest parts into small parts, clarify process and help to Plan your time/deadlines, which is also an important skill for developers. He can re-imagine the whole process of doing this task at pseudo-code logic. I think it's important to do with my team members, not only code together.
