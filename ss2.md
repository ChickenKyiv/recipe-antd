Another thing that I don't became one of that teachers(Don't judjing), that creating course only because he/she want to receive max outreach(I assume it can be done only for experiment reasons)

I find one guy -> he have a course with 3 lessons(nothing judgable) ->
but with the same logic.
You will be оценен не по quality of your content, logic of lessons, but by quantity(as usualy?)

I can apologize to that teacher publicly - if he didn't in order to
test how platforms work.

---

After whole these years I don't know what in professional at. But what I'm definately know that I can grow my community. Social network co,,unity.
And this is maybe my second skill. Because I know how to generate a result.

Maybe if I treat this course creation as a side-gig, maybe I will try and push more. I actually did everything well. I mean teaching part, filming stuff, publishing, etc. And received 0. Did i compare myself with their TopTeachers, that make 30-50k? Sure not.
I understand that they put a lot of time and effort onto it.
But I actually dont want to be a soldier or brick in the wall of just another company that create an online wewbsite. i did it before. dont like what i got.

Did I have hope that something will be changed? In future of SS? Also you just need to wait more and everything with work. No and I don't want it anymore.

I start to write this series after one month after publish.(Nov 17th 2018 was publish date)

So at Dec 17th I Start to go crazy because I didn't get what I expected. Another thing -> Skillshare start to spend cash by sponsorring them on my favorite youtube bloggers.
So I was like cornered.

I was like laying down, trying to procrastinate and forget about this and get few videos with logo ....


=====================
What I want with this articles? What is my goal?

- спустить пар
- я крутился долго и понял, что пока я не расскажу эту историю. Я буду думать об этом.
конечно я хочу feedback from team.
Not just "fancy" -> we are sorry to hear that your experience was bad and well make a notes and will try to prevent it in the future.
Bullshit.
I need or require an official online reply. It should be long.
And add big fucking line at the top of your terms - We didn't
guarantee anything. You can have a 0 result without promotion.

And I was sold by fancy videos at the Homepage.
Videos from Gary Vee and Kiosaki. It was a nice move from marketing team.
=====================

Did I hope to get in 12 month $1000 like this article [link] claiming? As you see - I didn't create this number from head, it was officially specified as AVG.

He-He, No, I hope that I don't make angry Skillshare team members.
I don't want to be a bad guy here or being banned from their website. It will loose all my possible feature income( joke ).

I think No, because it's actually few months gone(3 month) or you,
reader of this story, tell me, how much time I should wait??
I can wait. I have plenty time and with this situation I'm distracted from building my own project.

=======================

Each Sales manager know that company should receive constantly a lot of Leads and for some reason new leads sometime valuates more.
And if for the first months my course was attended by 2 people -> and both of them start if(but uncompleted)Made after 3 month of observations) -> that this is a very good convertion. But if you want build courses and have some profit from it -> better to have (100 visits that watched free minutes), and 2 students that start to watch premium part -> then you will be able to tell -> OR think


"Ok, so people are actually coming and view a free minutes(free lessons), but then leave. maybe I did something second? Maybe I need to adjust A,B,C or add X,Y,Z and it will change something. Let me try this hypotesis : (change title, new Intro video, Detailed description, etc.)"

After that changes I will wait another month and compare results. If it will drastically improve user engagement -. that your assumption works and how your level of Leads, connected to clients, increased
(I need to point to you, that I'm not only one, that has a same problem, few people, (I saw other 2) also complaining)

Let me give you an example, real stuff. You're reading this article on
HackerNoon(HN) it is a very popular media project and it has stable number of viewers each day. Let we call all readers on HN - An Ocean.

HN has sections, some of them popular, other are stable.
"Bitcoin/Crypto" is popular section. Let's call a section a waterfall if your article is cool it will go featured on homepage(I assume that is the logic of homepage).

Let's call users coming from homepage - A River.
Your personal followers it's a swimming pool.

( actually Medium didn't notify directly you about posts of your "followee" - instead they show you a new things. But this is another story)

So your article is like a bath and water can come from a different ways. Actually you don't need all the water to fill the bath.
All is logical, easy to understand, open.
Any new article(without specific topic, click bate, etc. should get at least 500 views - not reads).

In a case, when David Smooke didn't clap(please David, do it, I know you are reading) -> it will gain some views. And this is what you actually want.

You have a content. You work hard in order to create it. You sharing your content at popular place, with a lot of water.
People "digest it" (toher word) and give you their opinions. This is why I like HN as publisher.

----------------


I think I was mislead. Maybe I'm stupid. But I think I was told that my course will be promoted by this company. As Tech and Coding was their new section and very promising one (they plan to give it more attention). At least I was thinking that new course OR first course from teacher will be pushed to some social media(Skillshare, please learn marketing at twitter/fb from ProductHunt ;) ) etc.

("promoting") is a term. Or tell me then what exactly their offer to me?
Video hosting? Payment gateway(payPal is)
Good Community(Yes, It's good, But I didn't get a reply)

Also I was told that first one article will get me a $100 from then as a candy(not a lot, but It also get me feeling that if they can give $100 for first publish that each new course automatically will generate a some amount from students quickly)

Actually this first $100 bucks was a first breaking point for me, that change my excitement to a negative emotion. I first assume what (I hit button publish it takes few hours).

Then I receive congratulation with first course published and automatic release of $100  (anem of president)
But last item didn't was completed.
first reaction are confusion Ok, I'll wait.
Actually I decide to wait one month.

I was happy to code after big pause and just check my course views(and with 0 confusion only start to grow)
Ok 2 weeks was gone and as how month it was my first assumption to get BIG PRIZE.

I decide to wait more, because they pay usually in a middle of the month. After month never changed(I fill this day ;( what a loser, right?)

So I send a message to friendly support manager.
And she told me that i should read an article about BIG PRIZE on separated FAQ page. When I read the answer on that page I find a hidden term. You will receive BIG PRIZE only if you will bring 10 people that will be a new users.



So, it's a payment for affiliate marketing and I also get advice I that piss me off, that I can also use a printed flyers, that I can share of streets or at some offline place.

And Yeah, I understand everything. And usually I', patient person and understand a lot of processes.
As you see, I didn't jump into quick conclusions here. I wait and I observer and I give my feedback)

Side note: they told me that I can make more(in the middle of our initiall chats, by sharing with my people)

But I told them that I didn't plan work on promotion. For me is better to focus on product or at course production.

Another reason why I'm unhappy -> I start to work on a few courses. Actually this one was the one of the complex for me.

--------

And right now I have like half completed stuff and a lot of frustrations.

---

They not only distract me from my project few times. I also get another puunch and loser feeling.

---

They buy my beloved Youtube Bloggers - Curious Elephant, Joe, RealEngineering and other around tech people.

---

Did I tell you, how they SS find me?
Because of my articles ;) on Medium ;)
There only 3 publishers that I user
- Groceristar (my own place)
- Key Keyel QuickCode
- HackerNoon
And I was a good lead for them I'm not working(have a lot of time) and I always interested to explore new things

I was thinking
"Why not to try something new, right? You never know what tomorrow will bring to you. And what will be a good transition if you didn't try new opportunities"

So I tried and this is the story. It will be cool to provoke some discussion here. I mean if you think you have some ideas, like "you just didn't want to market it"
"You just need to do A,B,C and you'll get X,Y,Z" -> let's chat publicly, maybe apply a bet
and I will show you that ROI is very low at Skillshare(but it's depends on many factors for sure).

------------------

I have a lot of time, so I start to explore the whole platform. I find a main group for Teachers only. And at some point, I saw a post from other teacher. He was more experienced user of SS. He was a previous published courses(>3). He has a good profile. He has a number of followers and students, that totally completed their course(and receive a notification each time, when he post a new one)
He has some courses with a good number of students, likes, etc. He post a question, with a similar situation to me. I was thinking -
"Woo Hoo. I'm not the one with a problem. As he is a popular teacher -> he 100% will get an explanation or official reply"

NOTE: This group has an admin/moderator like a person that care of teaching success. I assume this person should follow all discussions, right? So she was a more about this post(or she did her work bad?)

+Off reply heading.

I didn't know -> will this "official reply" make me unhappy. But at least we will calm down.
Other teachers saw this post. And was worried too.
I can bet my ass (100%/totally/really) major players(like moders, etc.) saw it. But instead of answer and fair discussion.

They bury it. Actually, this guy(teacher that post a post) tell me that this post will be buried in thread. So it's not my words.

Instead of Reply -> Success Manager posted a New Year blog post, where they tacticly "advice" that teachers should wait some time with their courses.(when they will start to bying views/cash)
I assume it was related to us our concerns.
Second problem: they Introduce a contest. It was "sugar tasting" contest. teachers should comment about their New Years wishes, plans for 2019 years.
This post totally move our question to the grave.

Don't take me wrong. I'm ok with this type of posts. They empower teachers, good for community, fun, etc.
But do you know what also empower the teacher?
M fucking reply!

Community manager MUST(my opinion) explore a problem, that arrived. It's a part of the processes
Попытка не замечать - это не очень хорошо.

After this situation I realize that their my own problem, and nobody care and don't want to solve it.
