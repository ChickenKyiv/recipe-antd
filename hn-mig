The aim of leveraging any technology is to make jobs easier, for a greater mass of people.

Will our Liberty is violated in the process of applying AI?






Towards the end of the day, it is absolutely fair to suggest these highly autonomous AI systems are designed to assist humans. 
Therefore, it becomes critical for designers to built these systems in a manner, where the goals and behaviors of the AI precisely aligns with human values throughout the operation.

“Artificial Intelligence, deep learning, machine learning — whatever you’re doing if you don’t understand it — learn it. Because otherwise you’re going to be a dinosaur within 3 years.” ~Mark Cuban

First of all, thank you for opening this newsletter.

Today we’re talking about ML auditability: the ability of an auditor to achieve a comprehensive examination of the financial records and financial statements of a client. 

how you can check some results that were done in the middle of the model generation process. 

Or can your project ‘accept’ your co-workers?

Will they be able to help you. Or they will break anything and you will need to start from the beginning again?


[Key points: Documentation + Git. Track, compare, explain]

“But hell, if you want something done right - You just do it yourself” - It’s not a story about developers. We need to collaborate.




Ok, so Git should be important for the work of ML engineer. It’s clear. But what about comparing different models? How will you analyze data?[not finished] Or imagine even that one of the models was created by your hands and another one was generated by your friend. It can be a very tough and time-consuming task to work on. It can even break your friendship.

We generated a dozen models. Our goal will be to measure the accuracy of the results. Without achieving results with an accuracy that we want - we’ll be forced to run our experiments again and again.

[accuracy]
Our next goal is to avoid making more iterations and achieve goals quickly and without missing anything. Usually, when a few people working together - it’s important to keep notes.

Even simple notes, like “At day X I did XYZ” can save a lot of time. Especially on a complex project. 

Especially working together in teams.




And most of the ML experiments are not easy. Just try and open any dataset via your text editor: it loads very slow, and our software are not the best tools for analyzing large sets of data.

Machine learning projects are highly iterative; as you progress through the ML lifecycle, you’ll find yourself iterating on a section until reaching a satisfactory level of performance, then proceed forward to the next task (which may be circling back to an even earlier step). 

Moreover, a project isn’t complete after you ship the first version; you get feedback from real-world interactions and redefine the goals for the next iteration of deployment.

According to Gartner, by 2020, AI will generate 2.3 million jobs, exceeding the 1.8 million that it will remove—generating $2.9 trillion in business value by 2021.

if you think that it would be better to jump into code and work without common things like planning, defining project goals and conditions at your documentation -> please don't do this.

Quite often you will end up wasting time by delaying discussions surrounding the project goals and model evaluation criteria. 
All team members should be working toward a common goal from the start of the project and have access to all pool of knowledge fast.

Tool features




An important part of working at ML projects is related to data preparation. The better data you have - the better results you'll get.

Preparing and cleaning data is something that will become more widespread in the project process. This action is often the most labor-intensive part of organizing an AI system, as most firms do not have the data ready in the correct formats—thus, it may take a while for data analysts to perform this essential action.


The dataset should be continuously updated with the new data. Access to different datasets might be the main crucial factor defining which ML product is most successful. It’s critical to stay up to date on this and reach the best possible performance for your ML project, even post-launch.


---

Organizing process and environment for the running of your experiments is important for privacy as well. Protecting the privacy of sensitive data should be a high priority task. Privacy is a key to the success of the ML project: it's not just a personal choice or your right. It avoids the reduction of data, protecting its value and ownership.

Let's talk about Ongoing model maintenance
Realize that changes can affect the system in unforeseen ways
Systematically retrain model to block model staleness
If there is a shift in model ownership, instruct the new team
