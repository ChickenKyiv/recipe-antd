Resume

1) worked as PHP Dev, learn how to use Bootstrap - 2012 year
2) Managed my own company. We provided an outsourced software development services for 4-5 years.
3) Failed it. We run out of money and close it. But we have pending work from our clients to do. In 9 months we completed with my partner 2 projects that we owe to our clients. basically for free.
4) Right now I'm building my own startup and formed a team of interns, that want to gain experience in a real startup. As interns have usually limited real knowledge, I teach them. Not just languages, but how to code better, how to use different packages/libraries, etc.

At this moment I have at least 18 people in a process. They learn backend, frontend. Some of them will quit and didn't finish the course, for sure.

BIO
30 years old

Building my own startup for more than a year.
I was a founder of the outsourcing company 5-6 years ago. We build websites for our clients.
The outsourcing market starts to change and we didn't fit it very well.
We face problems with a few projects in a row, later it was converted into money problems. And we were forced to close our office.

We have a few ongoing contracts(clients went out of money but we still should complete projects for them - because we promised to deliver).
We worked with my partner from 6 and 9 months for free in order to complete those projects and not to be scammers for that clients at least.

We still have a dept in salary, so my current project (when it became profitable) should help us to close that last thing that relates us to outsourcing.


We always wanted to code our own projects. I reviewed and estimated a lot of non-local projects, so it was easy to understand that a lot of founders more focused on "playing" with the startup, not to disrupt the market or making big and "real" changes with tech.

I hate when developers created a great code and it's not used or go to trash.
A lot of times in my career I code something, but my energy and soul inside it. And in 1-2 years it was completely redone from scratch. Or it was closed.

This is one of the reasons why I start to build my own projects.
Because now I'm owning that code and I can decide what is better for the project -> because it's my main specialization :)





So, from October I send about 2400 requests to different people around the world. And about 68 people somehow help me with my projects.

Anyone that just replies "Yes" made a huge impact on our project.

My goal is to form a team and formalize the coding process. So I'll have more time without worrying about coding and focus on marketing, money raising, talking clients, etc.
Medium articles were part of my marketing process and this blog drives some attention to my company.

You can ask me:
But interns don't have a lot of experience, and your project sound complex, how you did it?

In my previous company, I was responsible for project management. I know(I assume I know) how to get things done with a small number of resources.

We using a modular approach now. I separated parts of the functionality, so different people can work on it, without worries about their skills.

Usually, onboarding to complex projects can take months. And I'm trying to make it smaller.

Right now we have about 20 GitHub repos, where we build different things that later will become a part of a big puzzle that we're making here.

I didn't have a job for 3 years, my friends that I helped before supporting me.

Our previous company was located in Kharkiv, but when we close our office - apartment prices start to be un-easy to pay, so in December 2017

I moved into a small coal-mining town, near Dnipro - Ternivka.

Ternivka was the first place of Groceristar headquarters :)

When we'll launch our products and start to generate some revenue I plan to move to another cheap town, near to the Ukrainian border with Europe. It'll give me an ability to apply to some European accelerators. I'm pretty sure that we made good progress and can be selected.

Before October 2017, I was working alone. I was coding a few projects at the same time. Then I decided to test one assumption - can I find some students, that will be able to obtain a not paid position. And I find some people that wanted to gain real experience. Not just work on their own pet projects that usually users did not use.
