> For sure I am interested in speaking further with you, Arthur!
I'm glad to hear that. Yeah, I think i was working a lot at February, and it cause some sort of small burnout.

> That is quite interesting and funny in the same time. Why and how are you giving their developers a hard time?
I'm a part of SaaS founders group, and members knows that I'm always telling what I think about their products.
This founder reaches me, was interested to know my backstory and ask if i can take a quick look on their product.
I did a lot of product reviews before(It was part of my job in my previous company).
And I'm quite missing it. So I spend a few hours and give them my notes.
Now this founder want me to see, how their product evolving. You know - critique is much easier than code a complex system :)

> is to understand your expectations and then confirm to you if we are on the same page :)
To be honest - I don't have any expectations right now. I mean I know that TopTal hire only best guys.
And I know that my experience is very unique. As you may know, I'm living in Ukraine - it's a country with a low level of living.
So if rate for my work will be OK, and I'll be able to keep my freedom - it can work.
Why I asked - because last the time when I was hired as developer was 8 years ago. After that time i'm outside "the race".
I hired people - developers that have only coding skills but with 10 years of experience for $3000-$4500 per month.
I sell them with additional fee, in order to make everything works.

About HackerNoon you can read more here:

And I'm actually posting some articles there in last two months.
for example, this might be interesting for you:

A lot of developers just want to close task, you know.
They don't really think about "whole food chain". Like if they will make login form work, but it'll be ugly or not very useful - people wouldn't sign up.
If people will leave = company will lose money. If company will lose money = they can fire employees and it can be harmful to employees families, etc.

I'm like from other side - I don't want to code because it can be converted to money.
I want to do things smart, code what i'm interested to code and don't reinvent the wheel each time.

It's also important to separate tasks between developers with different skills.
You can assign login form to developer with 10 years of experience. And he will make it work good.
But it's expensive. And waste of material as well. So keeping balance it's very important. By my opinion.


> How much people in line?
I mean that do you have another candidates for this position? I understand that in order to have a good hire rate you need to be in contact with other people too.
But I don't want to compete, you know.  I'm pretty fine where I'm now and I can continue to work on my own project.
But for sure, I'm interested in making some money.
Again, I don't want to be "Hello Sir, Yes Sir! Everything will be done in a heartbeat! Any wish".

> Reason why I ask you about Github
Right now code, that Groceristar producing is about 10% of what i did before.
I realize that and didn't ashamed of it. But with this open-sourced modules - i have another approach.
Instead of selling my time/codelines/completed functionality, that will make my client happy - I'm building code that I hope will survive at least few years, and can be used as building block of some other projects.
So instead of making something big, complex, slow - we're doing small, simple, and easy to contribute for other mainteners.
