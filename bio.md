BIO
29 years old
Building my own startup more than a year.
I was a founder of outsourcing company 5-6 years ago. We build a websites for our clients.
Outsourcing market starts to change and we didn't fit it very well.
We face problems with a few projects, later it was converted into money problems. And we were forced to close our office.

We have a few ongoing contracts(clients went out of money but we still should complete them). We worked with my partner from 6 and 9 months for free in order to complete that projects and not to be scammers for that clients.

We still have dept in salary, so this current company (when it became profitable) will help us to close that last thing that relates us with outsourcing.


We always wanted to code our own projects. I reviewed and estimated a lot of non-local projects, so it was easy to understand that a lot of founders more focused on "playing" in the startup, not to disrupt the market or making big and "real" changes.

I hate when developers create a great code that is not used. A lot of times in my career I just code something, put my energy and soul inside it. And in 1-2 years it was completely redone from scratch. Or it was closed.

This is one of the reasons that why I start to build my own projects.
because I own that code and I can decide what is better for the project -> because it's my main specialization :)




So, from October I send about 2400 requests to different people around the world. And about 68 people somehow help me with my projects.
Anyone that just replies "Yes" made a huge impact on our project.
My goal is to form a team and formalize the coding process. So I'll have more time without worrying about coding and focus on marketing, money raising, talking clients, etc.
Medium articles are part of my marketing process and this blog drives some attention to my company.

You can ask me:
But interns don't have a lot of experience, and your project sound complex, how you did it?
In my previous company, I was responsible for project management. I know how to get things done with a small number of resources.
We use a modular approach. I separated parts of the functionality, so different people can work on it, without worries about skills.

Usually, onboarding to complex projects can take months. And I'm trying to make it smaller. Right now we have about 20 GitHub repos, where we build different things that later will become a part of a big puzzle that we're making here.

I didn't have a job, my friends that I helped before supporting me.

Our previous company was located in Kharkiv, but when we close our office - apartment prices start to be un-easy to pay, so in December I moved into a small coal mining town, near Dnipro.
Ternovka will be the first place of Groceristar headquarters :)
When we'll launch our products and start to generate some revenue I plan to move to another cheap town, near to the Ukrainian border with Europe. It'll give me an ability to apply to some European accelerators. I'm pretty sure that we made a good progress and will be selected.

About ChatBots

It's a big and promising  field and I have a lot of plans about, but I find it hard to develop at the same time as our main projects (that keep me busy)
So our own chatbots are paused right now, while I didn't it find team members that can help us.
I did a lot of preparation, related to documentation. And I think with a right people - we'll be able to move forward very quickly.

I fill like a whole wall with papers, related to bot development only. But I saw that while I didn't have the cash to spend, it's better to spend more time working on my web project and back to it later when I'll have more time.

Before October 2017, I was working alone. I was coding a few projects at the same time. Then I decided to test one assumption - can I find some students, that will be able to obtain a not paid position. And I find some people that wanted to gain a real experience. Not just work on their own pet projects that usually users did not use.
