#### Details

I decided to create and use this folder in order to make less complicated.
actually, each file on this folder will have one method.
it will help us, because it'll make whole logic of our stuff more flexible.
and for example - it'll be easy to translate our stuff into other new methods, that we will be able to introduce later.


Why we're doing this?
If you know our codebase at fetch plugin, you may notice that we keep everything in one file,
and after half year it looks like shit.
It can be better.
